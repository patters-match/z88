<H4>2. BUILD STANDARD</H4><P>
There are two build standards of the Z88 Computer in UK circulation, an early model using Issue 3 pcb artwork and the current model (November - 1987) using Issue 4 artwork. Although electrically identical to the Issue 4 pcb Issue 3 is recognizable by the small number of hand soldered components added as a result of early development work. On the Issue 4 pcb the components have been incorporated as part of the revised artwork.<P>
A further version of the Z88 was designed for the foreign markets. The motherboards are marked as Issue 5. They have a metallised case interior and additional pcb components designed to reduce RFI emission to the statutory level.<P>
