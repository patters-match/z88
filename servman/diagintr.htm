<P>Three types of board are in circulation, Issue 3, 4 and 5. Only a small number of Issue 3 boards are in existence. They differ from Issue 4 boards in that certain components have been manually wired in. In Issue 4 boards, the printed circuit has been amended to accommodate these components. The relevant components are listed below:

<P>On Issue 3 boards, resistors R52 and R75 have been removed from the circuit and leave gaps. There is also a gap where R23 has been removed in order to be relocated in parallel with D9.
<P>The issue 5 boards have been designed for foreign electromagnetic standard compliance. The differences have to be developped.
