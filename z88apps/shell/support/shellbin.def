; Definitions file for Shell Binaries v0.25
;
; Include this at the top of your assembly file, and define labels:
;  .entry     : your code entry point
;  .end       : follows the end of the binary (used to calculate length)
;
; Registers BC, DE, IX and IY must be preserved.
; Exit your code with:   jp next
;
; The following variables hold values defining the command tail
; (see  binecho.asm for example usage):
;  cmdaddr    : holds address of command line
;  cmdlen     : holds length of command line
;  cmdptr     : holds offset of tail within command line
; Note that there is no point in examining the command name, as this
; is always replaced with "extern" when evaluating external commands.
; External commands may modify the area of memory containing the
; command line if they wish, including the following byte (this allows
; null-termination of the line if desired). They *must* "use up" the
; command line before returning to Shell; this is done by setting cmdptr
; equal to cmdlen.

        defc    cmdlen = $20F3
