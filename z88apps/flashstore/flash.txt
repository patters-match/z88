1M FLASH card
=============

OVERVIEW
--------

Thanks for purchasing the 1M (1024K) or the NEW 512K RAM/Flash card. 
Now, you will have a lot of room to save your files. 
The Z88 erases the Flash card, you no longer need an EPROM Eraser.

FAST ERASING - takes less than ten seconds to erase 1024K bytes.
FAST SAVING  - takes three seconds to save a 20K file.
LOW POWER    - takes a tenth of the power used by a standard EPROM.


FLASH CARDS AND EPROMS
----------------------

Unlike RAM packs, FLASH CARDS AND EPROMS retain their memory even when
power is removed. This makes them the ideal small file backup device
for the Z88.

Individual files do not get deleted on their own. When you save the
same file again to the card, the new file gets saved and the old file
gets marked as deleted. It is still there taking up space and can be
recovered. There is even an 'Erase file from Card' in FlashStore but
again this only marks the file as deleted. The only way of removing
files is by formatting the file area which removes all the files.


FLASHSTORE APPLICATION
======================

FlashStore is supplied as an Application and is like the Filer (on the
Z88) to save and fetch files.

This introduces a new concept for the Z88. In the past, applications
used to be in a ROM and the files were stored on a separate EPROM.
FlashStore splits the Flash card into two areas.

The ROM area which the Z88 recognises, is where FlashStore and other
applications are stored.

The FILE area (the area that is left over) is where files are stored.
This is the area that gets formatted (erased) when you want to clear
the Flash card. Fortunately the Flash card can be erased in 64K
sectors, allowing applications and files to be on the same device.
Where the split is depends how many applications there are and where
the 64K split line occurs.  This FILE area is calculated by FlashStore
when the Flash card is formatted and is displayed in the right-hand
window.

INTEL stopped making Flash EPROM chips in 2002. At the end of 2004 AMD 
made a similar chip, but threatened to stop manufacture in 2010. The 
AMIC chip was added to the list of devices ensuring continuity.

Gunther Strube re-wrote this program so the Flash card could still be 
used on the Z88 and added more features whilst he was at it. The INTEL 
stocks are now exhausted, the AMD and AMIC versions are now being used 
and the only difference the user will notice is that he/she can write 
to or erase the Flash card in any slot instead of just slot 3.

Rakewell supplies 1M and 512K Devices but Flashstore supports the 
following chips which is displayed in the information window.

   INTEL                 AMD                   AMIC

I28F004S5 (512K)      AM29F010B (128K)
I28F008SA (1024K)     AM29F040B (512K)     AMIC29F040B (512K)
I28F008S5 (1024K)     AM29F080B (1024K)

EPROMs
------

Flashstore is able to fetch files on EPROM packs in any slot. You 
should continue to use the Filer rather than Flashstore for all the 
other functions.

OZ 4.2
======

The flash card is now sold with two versions of the software on it. 
These versions are with OZ 4.2 or without OZ 4.2.

To use the OZ 4.2 version the flash card needs to be in slot 1. If you 
are using the 512K RAM / 512K Flash card, you don't need anymore RAM,
otherwise any RAM you have left, use slot 2. This leaves slot 3 for 
additional storage or RAM.

To start running OZ 4.2 you need to do a HARD RESET (card flap open and 
press the small reset swich on the left side of the Z88 with an unbent 
paper clip.

The Z88 will ignore your internal ROM and run from the external card.

OZ 4.2 is in continous development, so check on our web site and 
http://z88.wiki.sourceforge.net/What%27s+new+in+OZ+v4.2+%3F for 
further information about it.


FOREVER APPLICATION BUNDLE
==========================

As you would lose 64K's worth of space once FlashStore is on the Flash
card, we have supplied it with Garry Lancaster's compilation FOREVER
and ZIP utilities to use up the spare space on the 1M Flash card.

There are a number of applications that do not run on OZ 4.2 so these
are not supplied on those versions.

Details of some of the Applications on Forever and ZIP utilities are:

XYModem
-------

A Z88 popdown application for transferring files using the Xmodem and 
Ymodem protocols. Transfer speed around 3300 cps at 38400 bps using 1K 
blocks. Currently supported features are checksum and crc error 
detection, 128 byte and 1K blocksize in any combination, streaming -G 
mode (only for sending). Mailbox function to send a file marked in 
Filer. Batch sending with wildcards. Use :*//* to send all files in all 
directories on all :RAM devices. Ymodem preserves name, size and 
modification date/time of transferred files. User interface similar to 
[]X Imp-Export.

EP-Fetch2 - new version
-----------------------

This version of EP-Fetch has been specially modified to read all sizes 
of EPROMs or Flash cards in any slot (1-3), EXCEPT where RAM is in the 
same device - i.e. the 512K RAM / 512K FLASH card.

It can also read files from combined ROM/EPROM cards created with the
latest version of the RomCombiner program.

New features have been added including printing filenames to a printer. 
See whatsnew.txt for more details.

FreeRam - not on OZ 4.2. It is displayed in INDEX <>CARD instead.
-------

FreeRam is a popdown which instantly displays the amount of memory
available in the default RAM device, together with a graphical map
showing exactly where the free and used memory areas are located.

Press a number key (0-3) to view the RAM device (:RAM.0 to :RAM.3) of
your choice.

Alarmsafe - not on OZ 4.2.
---------

AlarmSafe is a popdown which allows you to save all your current alarms
to a datafile for backup purposes. If you need to reset your Z88 for
any reason, you can then simply load the datafile back into AlarmSafe
which will automatically set all the alarms back up again.

Lockup - not on OZ 4.2.
------

Lockup is a popdown giving your Z88 an elementary level of security,
which can only be circumvented by resetting the machine.

After activating the popdown, type a password (twice for confirmation)
and then press the ESC key to switch the Z88 off. When the Z88 is
turned back on, you must re-enter the password correctly before you can
cancel the popdown (again using ESC).

When entering passwords, every single key (including special keys like
SHIFT and the square and diamond keys) counts as part of the password -
only the ESC, DEL and ENTER keys cannot be included. Passwords can be
up to 16 keystrokes long.

Installer - not on OZ 4.2.
---------

Installer allows you to run true Z88 applications from free RAM in your
machine, rather than requiring them to be blown to EPROMs or cards.
This makes it ideal for trying out new applications, or if you have no
ROM-creating facility. It is also very useful for developers, who can
test software in a fraction of the usual time. DO NOT RUN THIS if you 
are using OZ v4.2.

Bootstrap - not on OZ 4.2.
=========

Bootstrap is a popdown which runs automatically after every reset. It
acts in a similar way to the built-in facility where a file called
"boot.cli" on an EPROM or card in slot 3 is automatically executed
after a reset.

However, Bootstrap is much more flexible and after a reset will execute
a CLI file called "bootstrap.cli" which can be located:

in any directory of any device (eg :RAM.1/system/bootstrap.cli)

on any EPROM, Flash card or ROM/EPROM (created by RomCombiner) card in
any slot, 1 to 3

This means that you can have different boot routines depending on
whether the Z88 does a hard or soft reset: keep the soft reset version
in RAM, and the hard reset version on EPROM or card.

Note that EPROM or card files must not contain any directory names (ie
just /bootstrap.cli is accepted).

This application only runs on original ROM Z88's, and it is being 
phased out due to the incompatibility of running it under OZ 4.2.

Other programs
==============

Instructions on how to use the other programs are in the zipped file.
Load them into PipeDream to read and print them. The file extensions
are .pdd.

The FlashStore application should you want to use it.

ROMCOMBINER.zip allows you to add any applications you may have to the
Flash card.

All files supplied are either zipped (.ZIP), Plain Text (.TXT) or in
PipeDream (.PDD) format.  They are as follows:-

ROMCOMBINER.ZIP     Adds Applications you already have
ROMCOMBINER.TXT     Romcombiner instructions
FLASHSTORE.ZIP      The Application of FlashStore - not supplied on OZ 
                    4.2 versions 
INSTALLER.TXT       Installer instructions  - not on OZ 4.2.
WHATSNEW.TXT        What's new in Forever 
XY-MODEM.TXT        XY-Modem instructions 
UNZIP.TXT           Unzip Instructions 
ZIPUP.TXT           Zip up instructions 
FLASH.TXT           This file

Please take this opportunity to MAKE A COPY of these files before
reformatting the FILE AREA. Save them to another computer or to another
EPROM or card.

Rakewell will charge users who lose these files and require another
copy but the good news is that they can be downloaded from our web
site.

+------------------------------------+-------+------------+-----------+

Fetching all Files
------------------

Don't forget the RESTORE function. Sometimes it is easier to fetch all
the files and delete a few unwanted files afterwards.

Erasing all files in the RAM card before Restoring

If you are using Directories and you want to erase the complete RAM try
using the wildcard //* in the ERASE command in the Filer. It removes
both files and directories.

Restoring or Saving Files to base directories
---------------------------------------------

Restore is usually used to restore a complete Device in the root
directory of the RAM. You can also add a Directory to restore
the files as well. This could be used where you wish to compare
files from two Flash Cards provided you have enough space.

Using two Flash cards
---------------------

If you have the non OZ 4.2 version, you can have your Applications 
(including FlashStore) in slot 2 and read any of your "master" files 
from there, whilst using the another Flash card in slot 3 for current 
files.

In the OZ 4.2 version (which is in slot 1 and RAM in slot 2) you still 
have slot 3 to use the additional flash card to do what is described.

To use two Flash cards first prepare the Flash card which you want to 
use in slot 2, with your master files. This is done by using it in slot 
3 to save your files first. You may elect to ZIP these files up 
beforehand (to save space).

When moving the Flash card from Slot 3 to 2, follow the following 
rules.

REMOVING AND INSERTING APPLICATIONS
===================================

Go into the INDEX and check you are not running any of the applications
on the ROM. If (for example) the Flash card is in slot 3, a number '3'
would be indicated in the CARDS column on the right-hand side of the
display.

If you are, move the cursor over the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES and use the
<>KILL command to close it.

Open the card flap (the Z88 should beep) and remove the Flash card.

Close the flap (the Z88 should beep again) and check that the INDEX
flag has not appeared. This should not be displayed on the top
right-hand corner.

Open the card flap (the Z88 should beep yet again) and put the Flash
card in slot 2.

Close the flap and check that the Applications appear again in the list
on the left-hand side.

Don't be temped to put the Flash card out of one slot and into another
without shutting the flap in-between times. The Index application
manager needs to update its external application list and therefore
needs closing of the flap after a card removal.

On the 2nd Flash card, you may want to clear the Application area to
give the full 1024K space for files. You only need one copy of
FlashStore, which, in this example is in slot 2. Use the Flash card
block erase command in RomCombiner to do this.

You can only Save Files and Format the INTEL Flash card when it is in
slot 3.

Provided there are no Applications on your Flash card, you may change
them whilst in Flashstore. If the card does not get read properly you
may need to refresh the display using the Select Card command.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION
=======================

To start the application either move the cursor down to the FlashStore
(the application name in the command window in the Index) or start it
with []J

The three windows (from left to right) are:-

The COMMAND window     - selects the mostly used commands
The FILE AREA window   - displays, fetches and deletes files
                         and shows you what flashstore is doing.
The INFORMATION window - displays device statistics and commands.

The COMMAND window
------------------

Seven commands are quickly available by moving the cursor over the 
command and pressing the 'ENTER' key.

The INFORMATION window
----------------------

When executing Flashstore commands the INFORMATION window replaces the 
FILE AREA window. It displays the following:-

Banner with the command name

Relevant statistical information to allow informed choices.

The filename already loaded in the command line ready for editing if 
required.

Warnings - if files are being overwritten or deleted.

SPACE is used to leave the window.

The INFORMATION window
----------------------

This displays two sets of information. 

1. When the cursor is in the COMMAND window it shows the following:-

DEVICE INFORMATION
------------------

which slot you are using in the Banner

Flash Chip Number or EPROM and Size

File Area Size

A Graphical Display of the complete file area. Deleted (grey), Saved
files (black) and free area (white) give a quick indication of file
usage and whether it is time to reformat the device and get rid of the
deleted area.

Free and Used Space in bytes up to 1K or KBytes

Number of Deleted and Saved files.

2. When the cursor is in the FILE AREA window it shows the cursor 
movements and commands available.

CURSOR MOVEMENTS
----------------

Flashstore supports all the cursor movement commands. These are useful
when moving up and down in the FILE AREA or for moving the cursor to the
beginning or end of line before editing.

<>    Up Arrow    - Top of the list
SHIFT Up Arrow    - Up a screen
      Up Arrow    - Up a line
      Down Arrow  - Down a line
SHIFT Down Arrow  - Down a screen
<>    Down Arrow  - Bottom of the list

<>    Left Arrow  - Beginning of line
SHIFT Left Arrow  - Back a word
      Left Arrow  - Back a character
      Right Arrow - Forward a character
SHIFT Right Arrow - Forward a word
<>    Right Arrow - End of line


COMMANDS
========

You have thirteen commands. They are selected using

     the MENU using cursor keys and the ENTER key
or   using the <> key command sequence (useful for .cli files)
or   use the COMMAND window - seven quick access useful commands
     are here using cursor keys and the ENTER key.

Three of the commands -** are directly accessible from the FILE AREA
window. These commands are displayed in the INFORMATION window to 
remind you what they are.

<> KEYS            DESCRIPTION

<>CE or   <>CF     Catalogue Card Files
<>SC               Select Card
<>FS               Save files to Card
<>EF or   <>FL     Fetch file from Card  - ** (ENTER or F)
<>BF               Backup files from RAM
                   Copy (file) to Card   - ** (C)
<>FC               Copy all files to Card
<>RF               Restore files to RAM
<>SV               Select RAM Device (Default RAM)
<>TFV              Toggle File View
<>ER or   <>FE     Erase file from Card  - ** (DEL or D)
<>FFA              Format File Area
-ESC-              Quits this application

Notes
-----

If the Z88's battery is low ("BATT LOW" displayed in right hand side of
the Z88 screen), you might still be able to save files, but the result
may be unreliable. SAVING FILES OR FORMATTING A FLASH CARD WITH A
BATTERY LOW CONDITION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

Before formatting make sure you have saved and have a copy of the files
supplied! (See Format) After formatting, you will have the unused space
for saving your files.

If the card you have selected does not support any of the commands due
to slot position or type, that command will be greyed out.

The -ESC- key can interrupt a command at any time (when user input is
required).


Select RAM Device (Default RAM)
-------------------------------

Changes the default RAM device for this session.

FlashStore by default uses the RAM device that is the Default device
set in the Panel []S. This can be changed for this session only, using
this command. Instructions on changing the device are given on the
screen. All commands that use the RAM will default to the value set
here.

The FILE AREA Window
--------------------

The middle window displays all files and size that are in your file 
card area. By moving the cursor over the filename (point and shoot) and 
pressing either

the ENTER or F key will fetch that file to RAM or
the DEL or D key will mark the file deleted or
the C key will copy the file to another Flash card.

Toggle File View
----------------

Changes between browsing only saved files or browsing all files (both
saved and marked as deleted). The top banner displays which view is 
being shown.

Normally the FILE AREA window displays saved files only. By using the
Toggle File View marked deleted files are displayed, allowing these to
be fetched with the cursor.

Catalogue Files
---------------

Lists filenames on file card area to a PipeDream file.

This command creates a file (default name filearea.pdd) listing the
filenames and size. Loading this file into PipeDream allows it to be
viewed or printed. Depending on which File Area view is selected, it
will either print saved files or saved and deleted files.

Select Card
-----------

Selects which file card to use when you have more than one.

This allows multiple Flash cards and EPROMs to be read using the same
FlashStore application. Highlight the Slot number (0, 1, 2 or 3) with 
the cursor that you wish to use. You may also press digits '0', '1', 
'2' or '3' to select the actual slot. The selected device will be 
displayed at the top of the right-hand window with the file information 
with current information of file data and space left on the card.

The padlock indicates a read-only device (like an EPROM or an INTEL 
flash card not in slot 3). 'AMD' or 'INTEL' labels are displayed on top 
line of each visual card for identified flash chip.

Save to Card
------------

Saves files from the RAM device to the file card area.

Wildcards are allowed,
Filename:  :RAM.1

You simply have to enter the filename. Always specify the device. You
are allowed to use wildcards. For example, if you want to save all the
files including sub-directories, in RAM.1, type :RAM.1//*.

When files are saved, the file size is shown together with the
"header," the amount of space needed for the filename to be stored on
the Flash File card. The program checks the data being saved is
correct. In the unlikely event of an error, a message will be displayed
and the file will be saved again. When the 'no room' message is
displayed, the last filename that was trying to be saved can be viewed
after pressing the ESC key.

If the file does NOT save, this is usually because the filename has
been mis-spelt or even that it does not exist.

NOTE
----

Normally the display stays on when saving files, but if the file area 
is on the same device as OZ, the display goes BLANK. 

This is quite normal, just wait, the display will return after the file 
has been saved.

Fetch from Card
---------------

Fetches a file from the file card area to the RAM device.

Enter exact filename (no wildcard).
Filename:
You have to enter the exact filename, preceded with the slash (/).
Wildcards are not allowed.
Fetch as : /                      [The slash is already there]
Overwrite existing file : Yes     [Yes overwrites, No doesn't]
Fetching...  Done.                [The file has been fetched]
Completed                         [The Fetch command is finished]
Press ESC to Resume               [ESC returns to Main Menu]

Don't forget you can use the point and shoot option in the FILE AREA 
window.

Copy all files to Card
----------------------

Copy saved files in current file card area to another flash card in a 
different slot.

This command is used when you wish to copy all the files from the 
current file area, to either an EPROM or flash card, to another flash 
card without having to load the files into RAM. Using two flash cards 
you can reclaim the deleted file area from one card by just copying all 
the files to the other flash card.

Individual files may be copied by using the Copy command whilst in the 
FILE AREA window.

If you have more than two flash cards to copy to, you will be prompted 
for its slot number.

Backup from RAM
---------------

Saves all the files from the RAM device to the file card area.

This backs up all the files (until the flash card is full) in your
current RAM device. Instructions on changing the device are given on
the screen.

Restore to RAM
--------------

Fetches all the files from the file card area to the RAM device.

All files (including sub-directories) on the Flash card are fetched
using the sub-menu commands. You might choose to restore all files
without checking for existing files. Directories are created
automatically in your selected RAM device.

Enter Device (or path),
Device :RAM.1                     [Change RAM device and/or path]
Overwrite existing RAM files? No  [Will prompt user to overwrite file]
Fetching file to :RAM.1/filename
Overwrite existing file : Yes     [Yes overwrites, No doesn't]
Fetching...  Done.                [The file has been fetched]
Completed                         [The Restore command is finished]
Press SPACE to Resume             [SPACE returns to Main Menu]

Erase file from Card
--------------------

Marks a file in the file card area as deleted.

Although files cannot be deleted from the flash card to gain space,
this command allows a single file to be marked as deleted. This is
useful for getting rid of those obsolete files that do not get
overwritten.

Don't forget you can use the point and shoot option in the FILE AREA 
window.

Format File Area
----------------

Formats and erases the complete file card area.

This erases the File Area of the Flash card and formats it. If you have
two (or more) flash cards that can be formatted you will be invited to 
choose which one you want to format..

When the command is executed, it says:

CAUTION! All data will be lost.
Are you really sure? No          [Yes formats, No returns Main Menu]

-ESC- Quit this program.
-----

ABOUT
-----

The version number of the application is found by pressing the HELP 
key when in the main screen of Flashstore.

MESSAGES
========

All messages are factual i.e. they tell you what is happening. What
they don't tell you is what you should do if you get an unusual
message.

File not found.
--------------

Usually caused by a spelling error. Use the interactive FILE AREA 
window to 'point & shoot screen' so that it picks up the correct name.

Last file failed.
----------------

Usually happens when the target file has no room to be saved.


MESSAGES YOU SHOULD NOT NORMALLY SEE.
====================================

File not saved properly - will be re-saved. Error. File was not marked
as deleted.

This message indicates that the Flash card is not working correctly,
usually because of a dirty card slot connector. If this message comes
up a lot, please contact Rakewell so that we can check the card.

FILE IN USE

If this appears you have a file that has not been closed properly,
usually by the Filer. You can clear this either by doing a soft-reset
or <>PURGE in the INDEX.

FAQ
===

1)   Do I need to format the EPROM before I can start saving files
     to it?

No. You will notice that there are some files that have been included
on the Flash EPROM that you may find useful. One of these files is this
User Guide. Use the Catalogue files to see what there is.

2)   Does the format only wipe out the text files? i.e. does
     formatting leave the 64K of applications untouched?

Only the file area is formatted. Applications remain on the Flash card.

3)   When I FETCH something from the Flash card, where am I
     fetching it to?

To the default RAM device as set on the Panel []S or to the Default RAM
device set by this application.

4)   Is this the same as loading a file into Pipedream?
     i.e. I can FETCH my documents from the EPROM?

You need to use the RAM device as an intermediate device when either
fetching or saving files.

5)   Can I EXPORT files from the EPROM directly to my PC or do I
     have to load them into :RAM.0 or :RAM.1 first?

No See above.
