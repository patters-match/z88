</big><br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
gives you the ability to produce your own application cards. Even
though Cambridge Computer produced a special adaptor for conventional
Eprom programmer hardware, they never considered the Z88 as a
serious tool for programming Eprom application cards.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Nevertheless
its possible, since the hardware was in-built right from the start.
Thank you for the File Eprom facility, Cambridge Computer!
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Further,
Zprom has been designed to take advantage of a modified RAM Card
that emulates an Eprom card. This will allow you to easily develope
an application card by simply uploading the code into the RAM
card. With a simple magnet you can write-enable the card, load
your code and remove the magnet to write-protect it again.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
will find the RAM card especially valuable if having tried to
develop a 128K card with multiple applications using a stack of
Eprom's and an eraser. First of all it's annyoing to wait for
the erasure process (when suddenly being faced with no more Eprom's
to blow) and the fact that even though the Z88 is a tough little
computer the slot connectors gets worn out some day. I've used
my faithful Z88 now for 6 years with thousands of insert/remove
card actions - the slot still works reliably but I guess some
day no more metal is left on that connector!
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


If
you value your Z88, get a modified RAM card to develope your
applications
and save your slot connectors a hard time. Otherwise, stick to
the latest technology, the 1MB Flash Eprom from Rakewell Ltd.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
latest invention on the Z88 front is the Flash Eproms. They perform
as a ordinary Eprom except that they can be erased electronically.
Commands have been implemented to handle them as well.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
produce applications on Eprom cards, very simple rules must be
obeyed: <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


1)
The Eprom card must be completely erased, i.e. not previously
checked as a File Eprom. If so the Z88 has blown a small header
at the very top addresses of the card and needs to be erased by
UV-light again.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


2)
The Card ROM header must be blown at the very last stage of the
production, otherwise the operating system gets confused and probably
crashes the computer.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


3)
The Z88 must be issued with a soft reset after an Application
Card programming session, since the card wasn't properly 'inserted'
into the slot.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
executes only on an expanded Z88. This is due to a 16K buffer
that is allocated when Zprom is activated. Zprom is designed as
a 'bad' application but is a one-instantiation application which
causes a minimal hassle for the operating system. An expanded
machine requires 128K RAM card or more in slot 1 (or if you have
V4 of the operating system, 128K or more in slot 0). The buffer
is used for copying Eprom and other memory banks and blowing code
into the Eprom.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
is activated using []ZE (or additional Z keys if other applications
use []E as hotkey). If Zprom cannot allocate 16K continous RAM,
you will be reported with a 'No room' error and excited back to
INDEX. You either have filled your RAM with files and application
runtime space or don't use an expanded Z88.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
activated successfully, you will be presented with two windows;
the left window contains a traditional Z88 command menu with frequently
used commands, the right window displays status information of
the current selected Eprom type (size), Eprom bank, Memory bank
and address range (of a selected bank). The following figure
illustrates
the start-up screen:<br>

The
two windows have been designed to be on top of the previous window
information (e.g. windows from suspended applications).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


All
bank and address information is displayed in hexadecimal notation
by Zprom. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
status information displays (from top): the current selected Eprom
type, the top bank of an Eprom (relative), the top bank of a memory
bank in slot 2 (absolute), and the current programming range inside
a bank. The range reflects also the 16K memory buffer. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


All
Zprom commands fetches these status values as default parameters
and pre-types them when a memory parameter is to by entered from
the keyboard.

<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="2"></a><big><b>2. Z88 memory concepts</b>
</big><br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
fully understand the commands and inner workings of Zprom, we
briefly introduce the organisation of the Z88 memory and Eprom
bank conventions.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
Z88 are capable of addressing 4MB of memory (24bit address range).
This is not possible by the Z80 processor itself - it can only
address 64K (16bit address range). The Z88 custom BLINK chip
administrates
the memory organisation by manipulating the extended 8 address
bits outside of the Z80 processor.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
allow the Z80 processor to see the available RAM, all memory is
divided into 16K blocks of RAM, identified as banks. Each bank
is assigned a unique number, held in a single byte (8bits). Any
bank may be bound into the address space.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
Z80 address space is divided into 4 segments each of 16K size.
The Z88 hardware has been designed to swap memory banks into each
of the 4 segments. However, the processor still only sees 64K
of continous memory. To obtain any available (bank) memory, the
operating system provides facilities to bind in any of the accessible
banks in the computer, identified by their unique ID, into one
of the 4 segments of the Z80 address space. The ID may hold a
number in the range of 0 to 255, therefore a total of 255*16K
(4MB) memory is physically possible to use in the Z88.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
8bit ID is split up into two sections; the first 6 bits (0 to
5) identify the relative bank number of each slot, which is from
0 to 63 (3Fh) - the upper two bits identify the slot number (0
to 3). Looking closer at the 6bit relative bank number it is obvious
why a maximum of 1MB is possible for each slot: 64*16K is 1MB!
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
Bank Identifier:
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<span style="font-family: monospace;">7

<span style="font-family: monospace;">S

</span><br>


&nbsp;
<br>


S
= slot number (BIT 7, 6 gives 4 combinations 00, 01, 10, 11 =
0, 1, 2, 3)
<br>


B
= relative bank number in slot
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="3"></a><big><b>3. Eprom concepts</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
operating system (and underlying hardware) uses a simple convention
with Eprom bank numbering. The top bank of an Eprom is regarded
as the bank with the highest number - in this case 3Fh (00111111b
or 63d). The lowest physically possible is regarded as 0. However,
no Eprom card has yet been produced that holds 1MB, therefore
the lowest bank number in any card would be to count backwards.
For a 128K Eprom, 8 banks are available - the lowest bank will
then 38H. The 1MB Flash Eprom Card contains 64 banks - the lowest
bank is 00H.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Further,
the hardware also sees this. In a slot with 128K Eprom fitted,
bank 3FH to 38H identifies the card, then repeated again in 37H
to 30H. This system continues right down to the relative bank
0 of the slot. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


There
is not provided any facilities that may identify an inserted card
other than trying to ask the operating system for a :ROM or :RAM
device. At hardware low level there probably is, but this is not
documented (the operating system knows how!).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
performs Eprom programming on slot 3 whether a card is installed
or not. This doesn't affect the hardware if a card is not present.
Reading the slot will return random information. Zprom therefore
quite quickly recognises an empty slot, since no slot can randomly
hold FFh (255d) values in a complete 'empty' bank.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


A
clean Eprom will only contain bytes of value FFh (255d). Before
Zprom performs blowing of data to the Eprom an initial check is
performed to assure that the range of programming contain bytes
that are prepared to be blown. If Zprom finds the correct value
of FFh it assumes the byte is 'clear'. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


An
Eprom is regarded as 'full' when all bits in all bytes are 0.
The blowing process of a byte affect only the bits on the Eprom
that are 0. The remaining bits are unaffected - the bits can still
be blown to 0. Therefore an Eprom to be programmed with FFh (11111111b)
has no effect.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="3.1"></a><big><b>3.1 Using the right Eprom type</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you are going to blow data on an Eprom it is very important to
select the correct type before you start the blowing process with
the <b>&lt;&gt;EPROG</b> command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


In
Zprom several types are available: 32K, 128K (and 256K) and the
Intel Flash Eproms. Use 128K type for that Eprom size and 256K.
The 32K type is to be used only for 32K Eprom's. Flash Eproms
may be used only with the FLASH setting otherwise you might damage
the Flash Eproms.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


If
you by accident are blowing a 32K Eprom with 128K type setup,
you might probably get error messages like "incorrectly blown
byte at ...". Blowing a 128K Eprom with 32K setup might result
in the same problem.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


If
you succeed in a blowing procedure with the wrong Eprom setup,
we don't know exactly how well the bytes have been blown. If they
will be "unstable" is impossible to determine. Always
make sure that you have chosen the correct setup.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="4"></a><big><b>4. Zprom concepts</b>
</big><br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
Zprom application replicates the principles of the Z88 memory
organisation. All references to the Eprom is through the relative
bank number of slot 3. This is because you cannot blow Eprom's
in the other slots. As described above, bank 3Fh is regarded as
the top bank of the Eprom. All commands related to Eprom manipulation
uses the relative bank numbering convention for slot 3 only.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
16K buffer is used by Zprom to manipulate any bank of the Eprom
and may be regarded as a mirror or copy-buffer. For example, when
a blowing procedure has started, the contents of the buffer is
copied into Eprom (plus enabling hardware facilities that activates
Eprom programming) and then verified with the buffer to assure
a proper safe programming session.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
current range always reflects both the buffer, the Eprom bank
and all other memory bank related commands. The range is defined
as a relative address from 0 to 3FFFh (16383d) which is the maximum
amount of bytes in a bank.

</big><br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Before
going into the description of the various commands of Zprom, a
few guidelines is appropriate for handling Eprom's with regard
to Zprom. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


An
standard UV light Eprom may be written (blown) only once. If it
needs to be re-written an erasure of the Eprom is necessary. A
new Eprom chip is erased properly the first time using UV-light
about 20 minutes. An Eprom having been used several hundred times
or more needs at least 2 times 20 minutes, preferably 3 times.
With old Eprom you may experience Eprom's that perform irregular
if not erased properly. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Erasing
UV light Eprom's three times in a row is a slow process, especially
when you need them to perform application programming tests. We
recommend a good stack of Eprom cards (5 or 6 at the least) during
software testing. However, work is performed much more efficiently
with a modified RAM card or the Flash Eprom...
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you want to produce an application Eprom, the chip must NOT have
been initialized by the FILER (e.g. by issuing a CATALOGUE Eprom
command). You will also get the Eprom initialized automatically
when performing a soft reset and a "fresh" Eprom inserted
into slot 3. The initialization process blows a small header (or
watermark) in the top bank (3Fh) that identifies it as a file
Eprom.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


An
application Eprom also uses a special header in the same location
as the File Eprom. Therefore be aware of what you do when inserting
a clean, empty Eprom card into slot 3.
<br>

<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="8"></a><big><b>8. Using the buffer commands</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
16K buffer is the key to program your Eprom's. Further, using
the buffer maximize the speed of blowing code onto the Eprom.
Since all the code is contained in the buffer, no I/O overhead
is involved in performing the programming and verification of
the chip. In fact, the Eprom programming on the Z88 is performed
just as fast as conventional hardware programmers on stationary
computers.

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
range affects all commands that manipulate bank data (editing
viewing, copying and programming).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
can change the default range by either using the direct command
menu or activating the <b>&lt;&gt;ER</b> (Define Bank Range)
command.
You will be prompted to enter the start and end range address.
In both cases the current values are pre-typed for convenience.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
might be necessary to change the default range if you're going
to copy a whole bank into the buffer and the current range only
covers a part of a bank.

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
load data into the buffer using the <b>&lt;&gt;MBL</b> command.
You will
be requested to enter the start (range) address of the data to
be loaded. The end (range) address is resolved automatically when
the file has been loaded into the buffer. Any previous data in
the new buffer range will have been overwritten. Please note that
you can load a maximum of 16K into the buffer.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
default start and end range will also have changed according to
the loading address of the file.

You
can save the contents of the buffer to a file using the <b>&lt;&gt;MBS</b>
command. You will be requested to enter the start and end range
address of the buffer. Both start and end range addresses are
the current range settings pre-typed for convenience. Please note
that altering start and end range addresses will not affect the
default buffer range settings.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
need to use this command if you're going to copy an application
Eprom as 16K bank files.

buffer</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
might be necessary to examine the buffer contents, or even modify
a few byte before it is blowed to Eprom or saved to a file. This
facility is available through the <b>&lt;&gt;MV</b> and <b>&lt;&gt;ME</b>
commands.
To just view the buffer contents in the current range, use the
<b>&lt;&gt;MV</b> command. To edit the buffer contents, use the <b>&lt;&gt;ME</b>
command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
one of the two commands have been selected (through command menues
or typing the command sequense) you will be asked to enter the
start address of memory you want to access in the buffer. The
default start range is pre-typed in the menu. When that is selected,
the view/edit window is displayed and you're ready to look. The
window are split into two sections - the first displays the current
memory contents using the hexadecimal notation, the second section
display the ASCII version (printable characters). All non-printable
characters (in principle bytes with ASCII values less than 32
and larger than 127) are displayed using the '.' symbol. Both
sections displays the same memory, just in different formats.

<br>


A
small window is displayed to the far right of the screen which
shows the available cursor movement commands.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


A
cursor is displayed at the first byte of the selected range. The
following cursor movements are available:
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Previous
byte, Next byte: &lt;LeftCursor&gt;,
&lt;RightCursor&gt;Previous
line, Next line: &lt;UpCursor&gt;,
&lt;DownCursor&gt;Previous
Screen, Next Screen: &lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;UpCursor&gt;,
&lt;SHIFT&gt;&lt;DownCursor&gt;Top
Bank, Bottom Bank: &lt;&gt;&lt;UpCursor&gt;,
&lt;&gt;&lt;DownCursor&gt;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
default cursor is placed in the Hexadecimal section. You may toggle
the cursor to the ASCII section by pressing &lt;TAB&gt;. This
feature is very useful when you stand at a non-printable byte
and want to know the value of that byte - just press
&lt;TAB&gt;
and the cursor is moved to the hexadecimal version of the byte.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you move the cursor beyond the buffer boundaries, you are automatically
wrapped to the opposite end of the buffer, e.g. moving beyond
the top begins at the start of the buffer.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you have selected the <b>&lt;&gt;ME</b> command you may enter
hexadecimal
values at the cursor or type characters directly from the keyboard
when you have selected the ASCII section. When in the hexadecimal
section simply type your hex-code. Only legal hex codes are allowed
('0'-'9','A'-'F'). Case conversion is automatically performed
so you may type your hex code both in upper or lower case. The
<b>&lt;&gt;MV</b> command ignores input - you will only be allowed
to
execute cursor commands.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
cursor will automatically move to the next byte when a hex or
ASCII byte has been typed.

<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="8.4.1"></a><big><b>8.4.1 Using the buffer as a
file editor</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
buffer is very useful for examining files, and on occasion modify
them on a byte-by-byte basis. In the Assembler Workbench context
it is obvious that you may use the buffer as a file editor for
patching machine code intructions.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


In
other situations it may be needed to examine the file contents
and correct a few control ASCII characters.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Please
remember that you can only load files that are not larger than
16K.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
using the buffer as a file editor it's not necessary to load it
at a specified address (otherwise load it where appropriate).
Use the <b>&lt;&gt;MBL</b> to load a file into the buffer. Then
you may
examine the file - you can just view it with the <b>&lt;&gt;MV</b>
command
or for editing purposes, the <b>&lt;&gt;ME</b> command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you have altered the file (buffer), just save it back to the filing
system using the <b>&lt;&gt;MBS</b> command. If you like, give
your file
a different name to reflect the modifications.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Conventional
file editors use a sector-size buffer for editing, simply to avoid
accidental modifications. When an editing is completed, the
sector-buffer
is written back to the file. Using Zprom as a file editor is the
same principle, using a buffer for the complete file!

file merge utility</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
buffer may also be used as a file merge utility. It might be necessary
to combine several machine code routines (that don't use absolute
addressing).
Since
you are going to merge files, start to load your files into the
start of the buffer. The range will automatically reflect the
total size of your files during the 'appending' of the files.
Simply
use the <b>&lt;&gt;MBL</b> commands for your files - take note on
the
end range parameter and add 1 for the start range address of the
next file in line.
When
completed, simply save the buffer contents from start range 0
to the current end range address, using the <b>&lt;&gt;MBS</b>
command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Please
remember that you have a 16K limit to merge files.

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


In
many situations you cannot identify the position of text or executable
code that needs to be investigated (or edited). You can search
for ASCII strings or hexadecimal sequenses in the buffer with
the <b>&lt;&gt;MS</b> command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
the command is activated, you will be requested to enter the start
search address. The current start range address has been pre-typed
for convenience.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
the search address has been entered you will be requested to enter
your search string. You enter an ASCII string by preceeding it
with the ' symbol followed by your string, e.g. 'this is a test.
Spaces are allowed. Please note that control characters cannot
be entered in ASCII search strings. Searching of ASCII string
are performed as entered - ie. case-dependent searching.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
default input is hexadecimal sequense. Simply type your hex codes
without any preceeding symbols. All hex codes must follow one
another without any spaces, e.g. ff80aac090.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
search begins from the start address and forward. When the buffer
end boundary is reached, the search continues until the start
address.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
a match is found, you are automatically entered the view memory
mode which displays the start of the found match and forward.
You can use the normal cursor movement as in the view/edit commands.

buffer</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Having
used the buffer in several occasions using various locations and
having overwritten different parts of the buffer, it tends to
get messy. Not that it matters, but if you would like to get a
clean buffer filled with FFh (255d) byte values then this is the
command to use.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


This
might be handy if you are going to blow a bank containing different
codesections and need to emulate the empty gaps (which aren't
used) on the Eprom. Clear (reset) the buffer and then start loading
the code sections.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
can only activate the <b>&lt;&gt;MBCL</b> command by typing its

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


All
Eprom related commands use the default range, Eprom type and Eprom
bank settings, as seen in the status window. Further, the Eprom
is defined to be in slot 3. Therefore selecting Eprom bank 3Fh
(63d) will select bank FFh (255d) behind the scenes (top bank
of slot 3). This is not reflected in the Eprom bank setting, but
necessary since the blowing hardware is connected to port 3 only.
The Eprom bank setting uses relative bank numbering, with 3Fh
as the top bank. The relative numbering scheme is also very useful,
since all operating system data structures uses this too. It makes
it therefore very easy to find the actual information on application
cards with regard to the pointers used in the data structures;
just select the relative bank with the <b>&lt;&gt;EB</b> command
as defined
in the pointer and view the bank with <b>&lt;&gt;EV</b> using the
offset
of the pointer. You can read a more detailed explanation of the
Z88 memory hardware in section 2.

This

whether
you want to blow <b>32K</b> or <b>128K</b>, <b>256K</b>
UV Eprom's and finally the new Intel Flash Eprom Pack (<b>FLASH</b>).
When Zprom is activated the first time, the <b>128K</b>

setting is chosen.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
is very important to have selected the proper Eprom type before
blowing, otherwise you might end up with lots of peculiar error
messages of bytes not being properly blown on your Eprom. For
more information on Eprom types, read section 3.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
select another Eprom type, activate the <b>&lt;&gt;ET</b> command
or
use the direct command 'Select Eprom Type' in the front window.
You will be prompted to enter an Eprom type in a small command
window.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
select the available Eprom types you can use <b>&lt;&gt;J</b>
repeatedly.
This will insert the parameter into the command line for you.
Four types are currently available; <b>32K</b>, <b>128K</b>,
<b>256K</b>
and <b>FLASH</b>. <b>32K</b> represents the
32K Eprom type, <b>128K</b>
and <b>256K</b> represents the 128K, 256K Eprom types. <b>FLASH</b>
represents the 256K, 512K or 1MB Intel Flash Eprom types (available

the current Eprom
bank</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


This
command is the very core or purpose of Zprom - to actually blow
data from the buffer of the current range into the equal range
in the current bank of the Eprom installed in slot 3.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
execute this action with the <b>&lt;&gt;EPROG</b> command using
the current
Eprom Type Setting. You cannot execute it from the Eprom command
menu because it is a protected command which needs to be explicitly
typed to be executed.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Before
issuing this command make sure that you have selected the proper
Eprom type, otherwise you might end up with an error message saying
that a particular byte wasn't able to be programmed by Zprom.
The Eprom should be in place as well...
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


There
is three phases of the blowing process:
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


1.
The current range of the current Eprom bank is checked to contain
only byte values of FFh (255d or 11111111b). If not, the command
is aborted with an error message of the first address that didn't
held the correct byte. All empty Eproms (whether UV light or Flash)
contains FFh in all bytes.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


2.
The actual blowing begins. The screen is turned off (only for
conventional UV Eprom's - Flash Eproms are being blown with the
screen turned on). Then the contents of the buffer in the current
range is blown to the Eprom. All bytes are usually blown the first
time. 'Lazy' bytes are re-programmed if they weren't blown the
first time. Re-programming is attempted max. 75 times of a byte
according to the hardware information in the Developers' Notes.
If the any byte of the Eprom didn't blow correctly, an error message
is reported and the command is aborted.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


3.
Although an implicit action, the verification and over-programming
of the Eprom range contents is performed during programming. Please
note that Flash Eproms are not being overprogrammed (all necessary
programming is performed by the Flash Eprom Chip).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
overall process takes approx. 30 seconds for a full 16K on UV
Eprom's and about 2 seconds for Flash Eproms. When completed,
you will be reported with a "Eprom at range programmed successfully".
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
blowing operating system data structures to the Eprom (creating
external applications) you must be very careful. Please read section
9.9 for more details. <br>

Eprom bank with buffer</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
verification process is performed automatically during Eprom
programming.
However, it might be useful if you have programmed several sub
sections of the Eprom in different stages and want to make sure
that all sections are present on the Eprom in the complete bank
range (0000h - 3FFFh).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
perform a verification of the current range of the buffer with
the current range of the current Eprom bank with the <b>&lt;&gt;EPVF</b>
command.

bank into the
buffer</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
also facilitates Eprom reading with the <b>&lt;&gt;EPRD</b>
command.
As always, the reading is performed by copying the current Eprom
bank in the current range to the buffer of the equivalent range.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Pay
attention to the range settings before reading Eprom contents.
This is particularly important if you want to copy a whole Eprom
bank into the buffer.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Reading
Eprom's is necessary if you want to make internal copies of application
cards. Set the range to 0000h - 3FFFh read all the appropriate
banks of the card. For each bank, issue the <b>&lt;&gt;MBS</b>
command
to save the bank to the Z88 filing system. To distinguish each
bank, name the files with an appropriate name and use the file
name extension to identify the bank number, e.g. '3f' for the
top bank of the card.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
completed with all banks, make a backup on a stationary computer
using the EazyLink popdown []L (default no conversion, no translation
during file transfer). It should then be safe to use the Eprom
card for other purposes. Please, don't misuse this command for
software piracy.

You
can easily view the contents of the current bank (and range) by
executing the <b>&lt;&gt;EV</b> command or selecting 'View Eprom

you will be prompted to enter the start address to be viewed.
The start range address is pre-typed for convenience.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Viewing
an Eprom is always performed in slot 3. You can even view the
contents of an empty Eprom slot. Try moving back and forth in
a single page - you'll notice that the hardware generates random
bytes in an empty slot when reading it.

Please

facilities.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Editing
of an Eprom is not possible. You can only blow information into
it using the <b>&lt;&gt;EPROG</b> command. Therefore an "Edit

command is redundant.

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you blow an application ROM header (at the top of the Eprom),
the Z88 immediately becomes aware of this and performs an initial
installation of the external application(s). Make sure that all
necessary data structures are in place before blowing the ROM
header, otherwise the system reads random information and probably
crashes the Z88 when the in-appropriate ROM header was blown.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


However,
the external applications have not been properly installed. You
can identify this by looking in the 'Applications' list - the
new external appliation(s) haven't got their hotkeys yet. Remember
that you didn't physically insert the card, but just put a ROM
header on the card. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
can create instantiations of the partially installed appliations
by just hitting &lt;ENTER&gt; on the name in the INDEX
applications
list, but we don't know if there is any side-effects. Please perform
a proper installation before running the applications.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


To
perform a proper insertion of the new application card it is necessary
to perform one of the following methods:
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


1.
Activate the INDEX. Open the flap, remove the card and close the
flap. The system removes the partial installation of the external
applications. Then re-open the flap and insert the card again.
This time the external applications will be installed properly
into the system.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


2.
Activate the INDEX and perform a soft reset with the <b>&lt;&gt;PURGE</b>
command.

commands</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
task of continously blowing Eprom cards for each modification
of data or code of your applications is a serious attack on your
Z88 hardware. Firstly, your slot 3 edge connector gets heavily
used resulting in bad connections some time in the future. Secondly,
your Eprom cards will need more and more time to get erased properly.
Thirdly, the time taken to test the new software IS LONG (inserting,
removing, erasing and blowing Eprom cards).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


This
tedious task created the need for something better. The Developers'
Notes V2 handed the solution: Cambridge Computer wrote about a
developers' package containing a modified RAM card, that would
enable you to use it as an Eprom card and to upload data using
a simple file utility. They never finished the package - just
a few months after the release of Developers' Notes they moved
to Scotland and dumped all Z88 relates affaires.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="10.1"></a><big><b>10.1 The modification</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


We
made the RAM card with the easiest usage interface as possible.
And it was in fact a very simple setup.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
RAM card has its Write-Enable pin controlled by a read-switch.
By simply putting a magnet close to the switch, it will write-enable
the RAM card. With no magnet added the RAM card is write-protected
by default and behaves like an Eprom card. Removing the RAM card
from the Z88 will erase its contents. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


However,
you need to have the right tools to open and modify the RAM card.
The plastic casing is strong around the four clamps that hold
the card which makes it difficult to remove the circuitry plate.
If you break the clamps, a strong glue is needed to hold it together
when re-assemling the card. A strong magnet is recommended too.
The read-switch is positioned as close as possible to the front
of the RAM card. Remember that the magnet needs to 'open' the
read- switch through both the plastic casing of the RAM card and
the flap (when the card has been inserted into a slot).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


We
use a professional engineer to make the modification. And buy a strong
magnet that attaches properly.<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="10.2"></a><big><b>10.2 Inserting, removing the
modified RAM card</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
RAM card is treated as any normal card when it is to be inserted.
Open the flap, and put it preferably in slot 2, or slot 1 if you
have an expanded Z88 installed with 128K RAM or more of internal
RAM and V4 of the operating system. Further, avoid inserting it
in slot 3 since it draws more current from the batteries (no problem
if connected to a power supply).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Since
the RAM card always will be empty, you can insert the card without
being in INDEX. The contents of the RAM card differs from an empty
Eprom. If you look with the <b>&lt;&gt;BV</b> command on e.g. the
top
bank of the RAM card you will notice a pattern of two bytes containing
FFh followed by the next two bytes containing 0. This pattern
is regular and changes order for each 256th byte. We don't know
why the hardware does this. But it has effect on the operating
system.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
can change the contents similar to an empty Eprom by issuing the
<b>&lt;&gt;RCLC</b> command (filling the card with bytes of FFh).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
is a different matter when applications are on the modified RAM
card and you want to remove it. As with all application cards
it is necessary to use INDEX to remove them. As usual, don't run
suspended activities from the modified RAM card. When you first
remove it, the contents are lost. You will then have to perform
an external soft reset of the Z88 to stop it squeeking.

slot containing the bank is examined not to hold a RAM device
(:RAM.x) since it would be fatal to upload your code into a place
where the filing system keeps your vital data. When all seems
OK the contents of the current range in the buffer is uploaded
into the equivalent range in the memory bank of the modified RAM
card.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


If
you haven't put the magnet in front of the modified RAM card,
then you'll be faced with a "RAM card is write-protected"
error.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
cannot be written enough: Be careful when uploading data structures
on your RAM card when the system is aware of your external
applications.
Especially be careful when uploading the application ROM header
- first upload all data structures (DOR's, menu &amp; help topics,
etc.) and related data (help text and executable code), then at
the very end upload the application ROM header. AND, remember
to install your new application card properly with <b>&lt;&gt;PURGE</b>
in INDEX. Please read section 10.8 for more information.

First

using the <b>&lt;&gt;BE</b> (Edit Memory Bank) command. The

interrupts to monitor application data structures therefore if
you have altered one byte of a pointer, the system is already
totally confused. If you are going to change pointers, then upload
the complete data structure - but before doing that make sure
that the information which the pointers in the new data structure
points at is already present on the card. This rule applies to
all kind of application data structures: DOR's, help topics, menu

You could off cource perform an external soft reset, but it's
easier from INDEX. The operating system then has a proper installation
of your new external application(s) on the modified RAM card.

Remember
to remove the magnet from the modified RAM card when you perform
a soft reset, otherwise the system sees it as a conventional RAM
card during the reset phase. All your application data will be
lost and you will have to physically remove the modified RAM card
then perform a soft reset, and finally insert the modified RAM
card again. This is necessary to reclaim the RAM card for pseudo
Eprom purposes and letting the system know that you have removed
a conventional RAM card.

The
new Flash Eprom (256K, 512K or 1MB size) introduces a whole new
possibility for developing software for the Z88. First of all
the mind-blowing 1MB would be able to contain all the current
available Z88 software. Next, it can be electronicallly erased
which means that the old 20-40 minute UV light erasing is history!
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Now,
you insert the Flash Eprom in slot 3, erase the whole card or
a 64K block and just re-blow your updated software, ready to be
tested!
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


A
few extra commands have been implemted in Zprom to support the

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
revolution about the Flash Eprom Card with regard to the Z88 is
it's ability to get erased electronically. The core of the process
is actually erasing 64K entities of the card. This is a new concept
to the Z88 world where everything related to memory has been designed
in 16K banks.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


All
the Intel 8 bit Flash Memory chips are designed around a 64K block
architecture. The smallest member is the 256K chip ("28F020")
having 4x64K blocks, then followed by the 512K chip ("28F004S5")
having 8x64K blocks, and the two 1MB chips ("28F008SA"
and "28F008S5") having 16x64K memory blocks.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Block
numbers are defined from 0 to n-1 (n = total number of blocks
on chip).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
has been implemented with the <b>&lt;&gt;FLBE</b> (Flash Eprom
Block
Erase - part of the EPROM menu) to erase the card. The Flash Eprom
Card can only be erased in slot 3 (due to the special hardware
of that slot).
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Upon
activating the command you are prompted to erase the complete
card. Pressing Y (for Yes) followed by &lt;ENTER&gt; will erase
all available blocks on the card. Pressing N (for No) followed
by &lt;ENTER&gt; will display another window where <br>


a
block number must be specified to be erased.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Erasing
a 64K block takes less than a second.

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


If
you have previously "installed" applications (with application
ROM header and related data structures) on your Flash Eprom Card,
then it is very important to IMMEDIATELY perform an external soft
reset - DON'T ACTIVATE THE INDEX, THE SYSTEM WILL GET VERY CONFUSED
AND PROBABLY CRASH THE Z88.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Before
erasing the Flash Eprom, make sure that no applications are being
executed by OZ on the card. Activating those apps after an erasure
will only execute FFh instructions (RST 38H) - in other words
a crash of your Z88.

It
cannot be written enough: Be careful when blowing data structures
on your Flash Eprom when the system is aware of your external
applications. Especially be careful when blowing the application
ROM header - first blow all data structures (DOR's, menu &amp;

remember to install your new application card properly with <b>&lt;&gt;PURGE</b>

<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Zprom
includes facilities to clone a complete Eprom application card.
However, to be able to use it, you need to have an extra slot
free, and that's impossible on a standard Z88 since you will have
a conventional RAM card in slot 1, probably the modified RAM card
(pseudo Eprom) in slot 2 and the Zprom application in slot 3 (the
assembler workbench eprom). Since Zprom needs an expanded machine,
slot 1 is used for extended RAM which otherwise could have been
used to get a free slot.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


It
would be possible to have a single slot free with a Z88 upgraded
to V4 of the operating system and 128K RAM or more in slot 0
(internal):
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Slot
1 would be fitted with the Workbench ROM (with Zprom), slot 2
would contain the modified RAM card and slot 3 free for a card
to be cloned or produced.
<br>

<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="12.1"></a><big><b>12.1 Copying a ROM Card</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Insert
the ROM card to be copied in slot 3. For V2.2 ROM owner's: Remember
to have INDEX active when you insert the card. Apply the magnet
in front of modified RAM card.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Execute
the <b>&lt;&gt;COPY</b> command. You will be asked to enter the
slot
number of the card to be copied. Slot 3 is always the default.
Just press &lt;ENTER&gt; if your card is present in slot 3.
Then
you will be asked to enter the slot number of the modified RAM
card. The default is always slot 2. When you have confirmed with
&lt;ENTER&gt; the copying process begins. It will take approx.
3 seconds to copy a 128K Eprom application card. You will be reported
with the "ROM Card is successfully copied" message when
the process is completed.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Please
note that the command checks the presence for a source ROM card
and that you haven't tried to copy your ROM card into a true RAM
card (:RAM.x device). It will report immediately if it finds such
errors.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
must also pay attention to the contents of the modified RAM card.
If it already contains ROM applications other than those you're
going to copy, you will cause serious damage to the operating
system. Just imagine if you have suspended activities of that
code resident in your system which is going to get overwritten
by the copy process of the new ROM card! Always remove the modified
RAM card from the slot, close the flap, wait a few seconds, and
insert it back <br>


-
the system has removed any applications properly and the card
is cleared automatically (there is battery backup on RAM Cards).
If you don't want to physically remove the modified RAM card,
follow the procedure of the <b>&lt;&gt;RCLC</b> (Clear RAM Card)
command.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
the card has been successfully copied, remove the magnet, activate
INDEX and issue a <b>&lt;&gt;PURGE</b> (soft reset) command. This
is
because the new ROM card has not yet been properly installed (usually
performed by inserting a physical card into one of the slots).
However, the system is already aware of the new ROM card. <br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
soft reset will install both the copied ROM card and original
ROM card properly into the system. If you look in the INDEX you
will notice that the second set of the same applications appears
with a leading Z in the application hotkeys.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
can now safely remove the original ROM card (probably inserted
in slot 3) during the active INDEX popdown.
<br>

<font size="-2"><a href="#top">top</a></font><a name="12.2"></a><big><b>12.2 Cloning a ROM Card</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


This
feature is an automatical process of copying all banks from a
source application Eprom (or the modified RAM card) and to blow
them on an empty Eprom card in slot 3. The <b>&lt;&gt;CLONE</b>
command
may be regarded as the pendant of the <b>&lt;&gt;COPY</b>
command, that
is to first copy a ROM card into the modified RAM card, then blowing
it back into a new card.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
<b>&lt;&gt;CLONE</b> command is ideal for producing ROM cards
quickly
and efficiently.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
will be asked to enter the slot number of the ROM card to be cloned.
Slot 2 is always the default. First it is checked that you actually
are going to clone <br>


a
ROM card, then if no RAM device nor ROM device is found in slot
3, the blowing process begins, starting from the bottom bank and
ending with the top bank of the source card. The order of blowing
is important - remember that the system gets aware of application
as soon its sees the application ROM header on the new card.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
the command has finished you will have a new ROM card partially
inserted into your Z88 because the operating system has recognized
it. When your're going to remove the Eprom card, it is necessary
that you have activated the INDEX first, otherwise the system
will remind you with its the horrifying squeeking.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
time to process an entire 128K Eprom application card may vary,
but is estimated to about 6 minutes. Cloning a ROM card to a Flash
Eprom is very fast <br>


-
about 4 seconds per 16K.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Due
to the relatively long time the machine is not reading the keyboard
while blowing data, it will probably timeout when the command
has completed - this will shut down the Z88 and it seems to the
user that something has gone wrong. If you awake the Z88 with
both &lt;SHIFT&gt; keys you will be presented with a
"successful"
message when the command completed (or an error message if something
went wrong). You can prevent this by setting the timeout parameter
in the Panel to 0.

using the CLI</b></big>
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


The
CLI is very useful when you have to blow lots of different files
on an Eprom.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


You
only need to activate []+K to record your file programming once
(assuming all went well, ie. no programming errors). When the
programming session is over, de-activate the CLI with []-K. Copy
the system file ":RAM.-/K.sgn" to your preferred RAM
device. Load the CLI file into PipeDream (as plain text), insert
<br>


a
new line at top of the file and add the <b>[]ZE</b> hotkey.
Save
the file back (as plain text) and it's ready to be executed from
BBC BASIC or the FILER.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


When
you are creating the CLI with []+K remember to explicitly select
the Eprom type. Even though it may not be necessary at the time,
it may be important when you execute the CLI file another day.
You might have changed the Eprom type and when executing the CLI,
the wrong Eprom type selection may be active and your programming
session will probably fail.
<br>


&nbsp;
<br>


Executing
a CLI file reflects a successful programming session of the Eprom.
If an error occurs during CLI execution, it will continue to be
executed since there is no supervising error logic built into
the CLI system. We have prevented such accidental executions by
forcing you to press &lt;ESC&gt; at an error message. This key
is not used in Zprom programming sessions therefore when Zprom
encounters an error messag
