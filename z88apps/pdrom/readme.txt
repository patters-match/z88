This is the "Public Domain ROM". It contains 4 applications by Richard Haw,
released in 1989:

Z-Help:
        Some useful information about the Z88, including CLI files and
        cable descriptions.
Z-Macro:
        Allows you to define macro commands available from any application.
Utilities:
        Memory dump utility.
Graphics:
        Utility to display Z-Image format graphics file. A sample file,
        demo.img, is also provided.

No source is avaliable for this ROM, so the binary bank images (and an
emulator version) are provided here.

The zhelp+zmacro.bin image is an extraction of the two most useful 
applications in the ROM, and is used in the Z88 Forever compilation ROM.
This image file should be located at $C000 in bank 63.
