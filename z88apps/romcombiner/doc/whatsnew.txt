ROMCombiner v2.06 - What's New?

When combining the OZ ROM and other applications for slot 1, the "romupdate.cfg" file

would create havoc on the operating system.

banks to just hit '1', '2', '3' or 'F' for 128K, 256K, 32K or Flash.

ROMCombiner contained a bug that prevented it from adding OZ image
and other multiple bank applications.

ROMCombiner v2.02 - What's New?
===============================

ROMCombiner has been updated to use the latest Flash Card technology
from Rakewell Ltd. The Flash Cards uses Flash chips from AMD and can

functionality, all Flash Cards that are managed by ROMCombiner, are
to be inserted in slot 3.

ROMCombiner v2.01 - What's New?
===============================

Since it's around two years since ROMCombiner v2.0 was released, you might
be entitled to expect some massive changes in this version. However, this
is not so; this release is just an accumulation of several bugfixes and
minor improvements.

The full list of changes from v2.0 is:

* Bugfix: When an error is encountered blowing a card, we no longer get
          stuck in an infinite loop
* Bugfix: Missing files are now properly checked for when doing EPR file
          conversions
* Bugfix: "Add card" option now copes with bad application DORs better

* Enhancement: The "Verify EPROM banks" option can now be given just a
               card size, and verifies the entire card is blank
* Enhancement: You can no longer accidentally quit the "combine" menu
               before creating a new card
* Enhancement: Patch warning message re-worded
