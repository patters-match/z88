ROMCombiner v2.05 - What's New?
===============================

application.

ROMCombiner v2.04 - What's New?
===============================

A nasty bug has been lurking for years inside Romcombiner:
When blowing bytes to UV Eproms, interrupts wasn't disabled, which
would create havoc on the operating system.

Gunther Strube, 4th October 2007


ROMCombiner v2.03 - What's New?
===============================

Use new API of FlashEprWriteBlock library routine.
Also changed Chip type selection user interaction method when blowing 
banks to just hit '1', '2', '3' or 'F' for 128K, 256K, 32K or Flash.

ROMCombiner contained a bug that prevented it from adding OZ image
and other multiple bank applications.

ROMCombiner v2.02 - What's New?
===============================

ROMCombiner has been updated to use the latest Flash Card technology
from Rakewell Ltd. The Flash Cards uses Flash chips from AMD and can
be updated in any slot (erase/write data). To maintain user interface
functionality, all Flash Cards that are managed by ROMCombiner, are
to be inserted in slot 3.

ROMCombiner v2.01 - What's New?
===============================

Since it's around two years since ROMCombiner v2.0 was released, you might
be entitled to expect some massive changes in this version. However, this
is not so; this release is just an accumulation of several bugfixes and
minor improvements.

The full list of changes from v2.0 is:

* Bugfix: When an error is encountered blowing a card, we no longer get
          stuck in an infinite loop
* Bugfix: Missing files are now properly checked for when doing EPR file
          conversions
* Bugfix: "Add card" option now copes with bad application DORs better

* Enhancement: The "Verify EPROM banks" option can now be given just a
               card size, and verifies the entire card is blank
* Enhancement: You can no longer accidentally quit the "combine" menu
               before creating a new card
* Enhancement: Patch warning message re-worded
