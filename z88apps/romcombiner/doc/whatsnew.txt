ROMCombiner v2.02 - What's New?
===============================

ROMCombiner has been updated to use the latest Flash Card technology
from Rakewell Ltd. The Flash Cards uses Flash chips from AMD and can
be updated in any slot (erase/write data). To maintain user interface
functionality, all Flash Cards that are managed by ROMCombiner, are
to be inserted in slot 3.

ROMCombiner v2.01 - What's New?
===============================

Since it's around two years since ROMCombiner v2.0 was released, you might
be entitled to expect some massive changes in this version. However, this
is not so; this release is just an accumulation of several bugfixes and
minor improvements.

The full list of changes from v2.0 is:

* Bugfix: When an error is encountered blowing a card, we no longer get
          stuck in an infinite loop
* Bugfix: Missing files are now properly checked for when doing EPR file
          conversions
* Bugfix: "Add card" option now copes with bad application DORs better

* Enhancement: The "Verify EPROM banks" option can now be given just a
               card size, and verifies the entire card is blank
* Enhancement: You can no longer accidentally quit the "combine" menu
               before creating a new card
* Enhancement: Patch warning message re-worded
