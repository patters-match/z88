<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction and History<br>
<br>
</span>When the Z88 came out, there were loads of different desktop
computers that were being used. This meant that to transfer with the
Z88 and any other computer would have to be simple and reliable.
Cambridge Computers initially came out with PC Link. This was a DOS
based file request program which used the Imp/Export popdown on the Z88
and&nbsp;required the user to type commands on both the Z88 and the
desktop computer. This was not very popular as it meant the user need
two pairs of hands. Around the same time you had another team working
on a PC version of PipeDream who wanted to use additional commands from
just one computer to talk with the Z88, like selecting directories, and
so the protocol of PC-LINK II was born. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><br>
EazyLink is based on PC-LINK II, using a
"file server" (Z88) and a "client" (desktop computer) that requests
file handling. It supports the existing file transfer protocol of PC-LINK
II for compatibility. This enables you (if required) to use the original PC-LINK DOS
application for transferring of files between DOS and the Z88.<br>


<br>
EazyLink's additional commands offers <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>faster transfer rates&nbsp;</li>
  <li>remote date stamp,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>file size requests,&nbsp;</li>
  <li>and backup only
updated files</li>
</ul>
It&nbsp;automatically
<ul>
  <li>creates the Z88 path when receiving a file</li>
  <li>creates MSDOS/Z88 line feed &nbsp;and ASCII character conversions during transfer</li>
</ul>

This document describes the functionality and facilities of the EazyLink File
Server. If you have purchased the EazyLink for Windows product, please refer to
the Windows help documentation of the EazyLink Client for usage of the complete
program functionality. Everything that this program can do is requested and displayed from
the Client application, as the server just sits at the other end and handles the
various requests.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>Activating the EazyLink popdown</b><br>


<br>


 As with all applications, they can be activated from the INDEX menu or by
typing the hotkeys for EazyLink. EazyLink may be activated by the []L hotkey.<br>


<br>


 The []L hotkey initializes EazyLink with the default setup of the original
PC-LINK II (no translation, no Carriage Return - Line Feed conversion).<br>


<br>


 During the execution of the popdown you may configure EazyLink with default
CR&lt;-&gt;CRLF and automatical ASCII character translation. This may be adequate
if you need to transfer documents between the Z88 and PC, where (PipeDream) files
need to be loaded into another word processor, retaining the proper line feed
convention and correct ASCII values for Z88 ISO characters (ASCII values
between 128 and 255).<br>


<br>


 The EazyLink Server is a Popdown - this means that it is not a resident
application that can be pre-empted (switching to another application) and later
re-activated.<br>


<br>


 When you want to abort the EazyLink Server, just press <b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>, and the most
recent resident application will be re-activated.<br>


<br>


 Please note that the EazyLink Client cannot work without the Server. You will
just experience error messages on the Client application and returned to some
sort of command mode. Only with the EazyLink Server running you will be able to
communicate with the Z88.<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The EazyLink transfer speed and serial port control</b><br>


<br>


 When the EazyLink Server is started, it sets itself to the following&nbsp;settings as the original PC-LINK II software. <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>9600 Baud on
Receive and Transmit&nbsp;</li>
  <li>No parity and&nbsp;</li>
  <li>No Xon/Xoff on the Z88
serial port.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
This is the maximum speed the Z88 can run under its operating system
OZ. As you probably have seen, the Panel allows you to select
19200 and 38400 Baud. The hardware is able to support higher transfer
rates.. We hope to implement 38400 Baud transfer
rates too, but this has to wait for a future version of the EazyLink
Server
(and Client).<br>


<br>


 The original Panel settings are preserved while EazyLink is running. When
EazyLink is aborted, the original Panel settings are restored.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The default line feed conversion</b><br>


<br>
For users transferring between Z88 and PC, it is normally required that files
transferred from Z88 need to have their line feed converted from CR to CRLF.
Text processors like WordPerfect and Word need this. Transferring a file from
PC will strip the LF character. However, PipeDream reads CRLF without creating
a double line spacing. You should save those PipeDream files back to the Z88
memory, since PipeDream automatically strips the LF as well.<br>


<br>


 Activating []L, you will have the CR&lt;-&gt;CRLF conversion disabled. Activate the
"Toggle Linefeed Mode" command until the message "Auto CRLF Conversion ON"
message is displayed. The old PCLINK II client makes it necessary to use this
command since the PCLINK II client just transfer the files without doing
anything with them. The facilities of the EazyLink Server provides the line
feed conversion and translation while transferring, if you enable them!<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The default ASCII translation of EazyLink</b><br>


<br>


 The automatical ASCII translation during transfer of EazyLink files uses the
inbuilt translation tables which converts between the Z88 ISO LATIN 1 character
set and the IBM codepage 865 (Scandinavian). This implicit translation also
supports the remaining european characters (accented characters for French, German and Spanish).<br>


<br>


 The translation table is always temporarily enabled during Client file name
requests. This feature is important for Z88 ROM versions that allow filenames
with ISO LATIN 1 characters (danish version and a few others). Viewing Z88
filenames on the PC will then display the correct characters instead of
rubbish.<br>


<br>


 The defined state of translation only affects file transfers (both
directions), i.e. you will only get files converted if translation is enabled.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>Specifying an external translation table</b><br>


<br>


 EazyLink supports the common translation of ISO LATIN 1 between Z88 and MSDOS
codepage 865. This is important if you run the the original PC-LINK II Client.<br>


<br>


 However, you may want to use EazyLink with another computer like the Apple
MacIntosh, QL or others using different character sets than the Z88 ISO LATIN
1.<br>


<br>


 The Microsoft Windows 3.xx or Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP operating system uses the same
character set as Z88! They just call it the ANSI character set. Using the
EazyLink Client for Windows, it needs a null-translation table installed, since
EazyLink otherwise would use the inbuilt ISO/Codepage 865 translation; this
would create rubbish characters in displayed file names on the EazyLink Client
using ISO characters on the Z88.<br>


<br>


 A command has been supplied in the EazyLink Client to upload a
null-translation file and then re-install that on the server automatically.<br>


<br>


 When the EazyLink Server popdown is activated, it automatically searches for a
file named "translate.dat" anywhere in the Z88 filing system (a ":RAM.//*"
search).<br>


<br>


 When it finds it, it automatically loads the translations from the file into
two translation tables in a memory area of its own. When the translation file has been loaded, the message "Using translations
from file." is displayed in the EazyLink log window.<br>


<br>


 If the file is not found, you will be prompted with the "Using ISO/IBM
translations" message.<br>


<br>


 The organisation of the translation file is simple; every translation item is
a pair of two bytes, the first byte is the incoming byte (the foreign
character), the second byte the translated byte (the Z88 ISO character). Each
pair is stored sequentially in the "translate.dat" file. The following BBC
BASIC program illustrates the file structure, that generates a null-translation
table:<br>


<pre>  100 REM Sample program to generate a null-translation table<br>  110 REM<br>  120 O% = OPENOUT("/translate.dat"): REM create file in root of cur. device<br>  130 FOR T%=0 TO 255<br>  140   BPUT#O%,T%: BPUT#O%,T%<br>  150 NEXT T%<br>  160 CLOSE#O%</pre>


 The following file dump displays the contents of the file. As you can see the
input and output code is the same resulting in no translation. This file is a
complete translation table ranging from byte code 0 to 255.<br>


<pre>0000h  00 00 01 01 02 02 03 03 04 04 05 05 06 06 07 07  ................<br>0010h  08 08 09 09 0A 0A 0B 0B 0C 0C 0D 0D 0E 0E 0F 0F  ................<br>0020h  10 10 11 11 12 12 13 13 14 14 15 15 16 16 17 17  ................<br>0030h  18 18 19 19 1A 1A 1B 1B 1C 1C 1D 1D 1E 1E 1F 1F  ................<br>0040h  20 20 21 21 22 22 23 23 24 24 25 25 26 26 27 27    !!""##$$%%&amp;&amp;''<br>0050h  28 28 29 29 2A 2A 2B 2B 2C 2C 2D 2D 2E 2E 2F 2F  (())**++,,--..//<br>0060h  30 30 31 31 32 32 33 33 34 34 35 35 36 36 37 37  0011223344556677<br>0070h  38 38 39 39 3A 3A 3B 3B 3C 3C 3D 3D 3E 3E 3F 3F  8899::;;&lt;&lt;==&gt;&gt;??<br>0080h  40 40 41 41 42 42 43 43 44 44 45 45 46 46 47 47  @AABBCCDDEEFFGG<br>0090h  48 48 49 49 4A 4A 4B 4B 4C 4C 4D 4D 4E 4E 4F 4F  HHIIJJKKLLMMNNOO<br>00A0h  50 50 51 51 52 52 53 53 54 54 55 55 56 56 57 57  PPQQRRSSTTUUVVWW<br>00B0h  58 58 59 59 5A 5A 5B 5B 5C 5C 5D 5D 5E 5E 5F 5F  XXYYZZ[[\\]]^^__<br>00C0h  60 60 61 61 62 62 63 63 64 64 65 65 66 66 67 67  ``aabbccddeeffgg<br>00D0h  68 68 69 69 6A 6A 6B 6B 6C 6C 6D 6D 6E 6E 6F 6F  hhiijjkkllmmnnoo<br>00E0h  70 70 71 71 72 72 73 73 74 74 75 75 76 76 77 77  ppqqrrssttuuvvww<br>00F0h  78 78 79 79 7A 7A 7B 7B 7C 7C 7D 7D 7E 7E 7F 7F  xxyyzz{{||}}~~..<br>0100h  80 80 81 81 82 82 83 83 84 84 85 85 86 86 87 87  ................<br>0110h  88 88 89 89 8A 8A 8B 8B 8C 8C 8D 8D 8E 8E 8F 8F  ................<br>0120h  90 90 91 91 92 92 93 93 94 94 95 95 96 96 97 97  ................<br>0130h  98 98 99 99 9A 9A 9B 9B 9C 9C 9D 9D 9E 9E 9F 9F  ................<br>0140h  A0 A0 A1 A1 A2 A2 A3 A3 A4 A4 A5 A5 A6 A6 A7 A7  ................<br>0150h  A8 A8 A9 A9 AA AA AB AB AC AC AD AD AE AE AF AF  ................<br>0160h  B0 B0 B1 B1 B2 B2 B3 B3 B4 B4 B5 B5 B6 B6 B7 B7  ................<br>0170h  B8 B8 B9 B9 BA BA BB BB BC BC BD BD BE BE BF BF  ................<br>0180h  C0 C0 C1 C1 C2 C2 C3 C3 C4 C4 C5 C5 C6 C6 C7 C7  ................<br>0190h  C8 C8 C9 C9 CA CA CB CB CC CC CD CD CE CE CF CF  ................<br>01A0h  D0 D0 D1 D1 D2 D2 D3 D3 D4 D4 D5 D5 D6 D6 D7 D7  ................<br>01B0h  D8 D8 D9 D9 DA DA DB DB DC DC DD DD DE DE DF DF  ................<br>01C0h  E0 E0 E1 E1 E2 E2 E3 E3 E4 E4 E5 E5 E6 E6 E7 E7  ................<br>01D0h  E8 E8 E9 E9 EA EA EB EB EC EC ED ED EE EE EF EF  ................<br>01E0h  F0 F0 F1 F1 F2 F2 F3 F3 F4 F4 F5 F5 F6 F6 F7 F7  ................<br>01F0h  F8 F8 F9 F9 FA FA FB FB FC FC FD FD FE FE FF FF  ................<br></pre>



 Your translation file doesn't need to contain all the codes. This isn't
necessary, since you don't need to convert the standard ASCII values ranging
from 32 to 127 - these are the same in all the ASCII tables. The difference
occurs from byte code 128 to 255. Many computers have aquired their own
standards, e.g. the different Codepage scheme on the MS-DOS environment, the
ISO LATIN 1 standard on the Z88, and various other standards found on other
computers.<br>


<br>


 As a Dane, a German, a Norwegian Z88 user or other users requiring accented
characters, it is only needed to create a translation table of 8 - 10
translation items for the various special characters used in their language.
Before loading a "translate.dat" file, a null-translation table is first setup
in memory, then the codes is loaded into the table from the file.<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The EazyLink Command Menu</b><br>


<br>


 The popdown presents you with the a few commands to toggle the various
translation and conversion facilities of EazyLink. They all have meaning only
for the original PC LINK II DOS Client. This application only supports raw file
transfers. Any conversion would then have to be performed afterwards.<br>


<br>


 Using the commands of the EazyLink Server you may perform automatical
conversion during transfer using the old PC LINK II DOS application.<br>


<br>


 The EazyLink for Windows Client handles the translation and conversion status
automatically by providing commands to toggle the conversion status. The
EazyLink Client then pre-sets the EazyLink Server with the current conversion
status before any file transfer if started.<br>


<br>


"Toggle Translation Mode"<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; on this command toggles between "Auto Translation ON" or
"OFF". Having toggled the command to "ON" will perform automatical translation
of characters in the currently loaded (or default) translation table while file
transfer is processed.<br>


<br>


"Toggle Linefeed Mode"<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; on this command toggles between "Auto CRLF Conversion ON" or
"OFF". Having toggled the command to "ON" will perform automatical
linefeed conversion while file transfer is processed. Transferring the file
from Z88 to remote computer performs CR -&gt; CRLF linefeed conversion, and CRLF
-&gt; CR when transferring from remote computer to Z88.<br>


<br>


"Use ISO/IBM Translations"<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; on this command will install the default ISO LATIN I / IBM
Codepage 865 translation table. Use this when you need to transfer files to
the PC when using MS DOS word processors or editors. This translation table has
only relevance for Z88 text containing accented characters.<br>


<br>


"Load Translations"<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; on this command will try to load an external translation
table from a file and install it as the default translation table.
 The file searched must be named as "translate.dat" and may be placed anywhere
in the Z88 filing system (a ":RAM.//*" search is performed by EazyLink).<br>


<br>


 When the translation file has been loaded, the message "Using translations
from file." is displayed in the EazyLink log window. If the file was not found,
the default ISO LATIN I / IBM Codepage 865 table is installed instead.<br>


<br>


"Quit EazyLink"<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; on this command will close the serial port and re-install the
previous Panel settings. Finally, EazyLink will terminate it self and return to
Index (or another activated resident application).<br>


<br>


 Pressing &lt;ESC&gt; in EazyLink will also perform the termination of the popdown.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The EazyLink File Transfer Protocol</b><br>


<br>


 You might have another computer you want to interface with EazyLink. This
documentation provides you with the information to develop your Client
application to interface with the EazyLink Server.<br>


<br>


 The current version of the EazyLink server is 5.0.4.<br>


<br>


For each command description you will see the version number it was developed
in. The highest version number always contains all features below of the
current version number.<br>


<br>


<br>


- The initialisation<br>


<br>


 When the EazyLink Server is activated it automatically resets the serial port
to 9600 baud for both Receive and Transmit Rates, with No Parity and No
Xon/Xoff on the Z88 serial port. Then, a translation table is loaded; either
from the external file "translate.dat" or using the internal ISO/IBM standard.<br>


<br>


- The main loop<br>


<br>


 EazyLink now just listens to the serial port for commands to perform (or
awaits a command from the keyboard). You may press &lt;ESC&gt; to abort EazyLink
(KILLing the popdown) or any other protocol command that currently is being
processed.<br>


<br>


<br>


The main loop waits for two different protocol headers:<br>


<br>


1. The PC-LINK II protocol header identifier
2. The EazyLink protocol header identifier<br>


<br>


 The protocol header determines how the serial port byte stream is parsed. All
request commands are initialized with a protocol header.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>PC-LINK II Protocol Header</b><br>


<br>


 The Client application sends a byte sequense of ASCII value &lt;5&gt; ended with
byte value &lt;6&gt;. The Client may use any number of &lt;5&gt;'s but only one ending &lt;6&gt;.
As soon as EazyLink receives the first &lt;5&gt;, it begins to listen for the ending
&lt;6&gt;. When &lt;6&gt; has been received, EazyLink Server immediately answers with
&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;6&gt; to acknowledge to the Client that it has received the protocol
header. The following figure illustrates the request/response action:<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;6&gt;             -&gt;  waiting               PC-LINK II Protocol header<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;5&gt;&lt;5&gt;&lt;6&gt;             Acknowledge protocol header<br>                                                Awaiting PC-LINK II command<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>


<br>


<br>


<b>EazyLink Protocol Header</b><br>


<br>


 The second protocol header for the improved byte stream protocol is similar to
the PC-LINK II header, but uses byte values &lt;1&gt; and &lt;2&gt; instead:<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;1&gt;&lt;1&gt;&lt;2&gt;             -&gt;  waiting               EazyLink Protocol header<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;1&gt;&lt;1&gt;&lt;2&gt;             Acknowledge protocol header<br>                                                Awaiting EazyLink command...<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>


<br>


<br>


<b>PC-LINK II byte stream protocol</b><br>


<br>


 When the protocol header has been acknowledged by the Client, the byte stream
transmission can begin. For each byte sent from the Client, the byte received
by the server is acknowledged with a null &lt;0&gt; indicating a successful reception
of the byte. When the Client has received the &lt;0&gt;, it is ready to transmit the
next byte.<br>


<br>


 If the server somehow cannot cope with receiving the byte (e.g. if the byte is
part of a file transmission and no room is left in the Z88), the server will
acknowledge with &lt;1&gt; indicating an error status.<br>


<br>


 It is the responsibility of the Client to stop with further transmission of
the command process and abort, possibly returning an appropriate error to the
user. The following action table illustrates the PC-LINK II byte stream
protocol:<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;byte&gt;                -&gt;  waiting               send byte to server<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;0&gt;                   byte received successfully<br>                                                or<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;1&gt;                   error condition<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>


<br>


<br>


 The opposite byte stream flow is of the same principle; when the EazyLink
Server sends a byte to the Client, it has to answer with a &lt;0&gt; or &lt;1&gt; if an
error condition is active:<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Server                    Client                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;byte&gt;                -&gt;  waiting               send byte to client<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;0&gt;                   byte received successfully<br>                                                or<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;1&gt;                   error condition<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>


<br>


<br>


<b>EazyLink byte stream protocol</b><br>


<br>


 When the protocol header has been acknowledged by the Client, the byte stream
transmission can begin. This protocol is controlled by the underlying hardware
byte flow - in other words, the request commands and their implicit logical
construction are the byte stream protocol.<br>


<br>


 The PC-LINK II protocol (see above) uses the two-way check byte for each byte
sent; this is a way to implement a system of sending bytes between two
computers that do not have a hardware handshake. However, the total information
sent between both computers are doubled with the penalty of an even slower
transmission. The EazyLink avoids this by using the hardware handshaking of
today's high speed serial ports and the Z88.<br>


<br>


 With the Eazy'er protocol, information is transmitted as fast as the RS-232
9600 Baud rate can perform between the two computers.<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>Timeout - waiting for information</b><br>


<br>


 The EazyLink Server uses an implicit timeout of 30 seconds in all serial port
communications. If you aborted the Client (Killed the application) while it was
receiving a file from the Z88, the EazyLink Server suddenly couldn't transfer
since the serial port buffer was filled. Then, it automatically waites 30
seconds to continue sending data to the serial port. If timeout occurs, the
current command request is automatically aborted, and EazyLink returns to the
main loop awaiting a new command request.<br>


<br>


 The same principle applies when the information flow is aborted during
receiving data from the Client.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>The EazyLink Request Commands, with PC-LINK II compatibility</b><br>


<br>


 The described list below of various commands that may be sent to the EazyLink
Server uses the diagram prototype as seen above for easy understanding for the
flow of byte stream between the EazyLink Client (remote computer) and Server
(Z88).<br>


<br>


 The list below contains both the PC-LINK II compatible requests and extended
commands. A version number is also supplied which identifies the implementation
of the EazyLink server containg the particular command.<br>


<br>


 Please remember that all request commands are pre-ambled with the appropriate
protocol header as described previously. The following symbols are used:<br>


<pre>&lt;&gt;                    Describes a syntactic entity, e.g. a request command<br><br>ESC                   Identifies the ASCII value 27, the request command<br>                      header.<br><br>"A"                   Identifies the ASCII character "A" (byte value 65).<br></pre>

<b>Hello Z88 (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 This is a simple command that answers the Client on the request 'hello, Z88
are your there?'. This command is used by the original PC-LINK II MS-DOS Client
to "log on" to the Z88 PC-LINK II Server. If the Z88 isn't connected to the PC
or the Z88 is shut down, the Client reports that "No connection is available".<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;ESC "A"&gt;             -&gt;  waiting               Hello, are you there?<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;ESC "Y"&gt;             Yes!<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>

<b>Get Device Names (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


Request for Z88 RAM device names (both internal and external).<br>

<br>


<b>Get Directory Names (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 Request for Z88 Directory Names in the current specified valid path, ended
with the path separator "/". The specified path will be added with the "*" (all
names) wildcard symbol by the EazyLink server, which is standard according to
the PC-LINK II specification.<br>


<br>


 The EazyLink Server always returns the "." name which identifies the current
directory. Then, if the specified path in the request command defines one
sub-directory or more, a ".." parent directory name is sent as well. Both
identifiers as sent before any local directory names.<br>


<br>


 As shown below, each name is sent with a leading ESC "N"; the indicator that a
name follows. When the last name has been transmitted ESC "Z" is sent.
Directory names are sent without path specification.<br>

<br>


<b>Receive File from Z88 (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 Request for Z88 File as specified in the command header. Please note that
wildcards is allowed, but not recommended since you might get the wrong file if
another match is found in the Z88 filing system than expected.<br>


<br>


 Please note that the current translation status reflects the data sent to Z88.
Activating the []L popdown, the default translation is NONE with no line feed
conversion, ie. every byte sent the Z88 is unaffected. This is the original
state of the PC-LINK II Server popdown.<br>


<br>


 If you chose to activate one of the translation/conversion commands, every
byte sent the Z88 is translated using either the internal ISO/IBM Codepage 865
or an external "translate.dat" translation table.<br>


<br>


 The translation and line feed conversion status may also have been enabled or
disabled using the appropriate request commands (see later). However, this may
only be possible using the EazyLink extended protocol (the original PC-LINK II
client doesn't support translation nor line feed conversion during transfer
using the EazyLink interface). Translation must be performed after the PC-LINK
II transfer.<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;ESC "G"&gt;                                       Request for file to be sent<br>&lt;FileName&gt;                                      from Z88<br>&lt;ESC "Z"&gt;             -&gt;  receiving filename<br><br>receiving             &lt;-  &lt;File&gt;                Send file contents...<br>receiving             &lt;-  &lt;ESC "Z"&gt;             End of File<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>


<br>


<br>


<b>Sending an Escape (or binary) character (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 During file transfer from the Z88 or the Client an Escape character sequense
is sent when a true ESC byte needs to be transmitted, and not a request
command. The Escape sequense is as follows:<br>


<pre>                      ESC "B" &lt;H1&gt;&lt;H2&gt;</pre>


where H1 and H2 are the corresponding hexadecimal high and low nibbles of the
byte representation.<br>


<br>


The actual sequense sent is &lt;ESC "B" "1B"&gt; for the single ESC byte, or<br>


<pre>                      27,"B","1","B"</pre>


in a simple flow of bytes representing the single ESC byte to be sent. The
Escape sequense principle is a copy from the protocol used by the Imp/Export
popdown which was used to transfer byte values larger than 127.<br>


<br>


 The Client or Server need only to use the Escape sequense when transfering
binary files (text files like PipeDream files don't contain the ESC character).<br>


<br>


 The actual PC-LINK II Client application also uses the ESC "B" to transmit
'binary' characters that have ASCII values above 127. This system is redundant,
however, PC-LINK II regard it as necessary. All 'binary' ASCII characters,
except ESC, are sent normally from the EazyLink Server to the PC-LINK II which
receives them perfectly. This scheme seems to be more of a symbolic design than
an efficient implementation.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<b>Send Files to Z88 from Client (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 Request for sending Files to Z88 from Client as specified in the command
header. Please note that wildcards may not be used, only exact filenames.<br>


<br>


 Any path specified in the filename is automatically created by the EazyLink
Server when the file is being created on the Z88 (successfully receiving the
filename).<br>


<br>


 The request command allows for several files to be sent during the same
command session.<br>


<br>


 Please note that the current translation status reflects the data sent to Z88.
Activating the []L popdown, the default translation is NONE with no line feed
conversion, ie. every byte sent the Z88 is unaffected. This is the original
state of the PC-LINK II Server popdown.<br>

<b>Remote aborting of the EazyLink Server (PC-LINK II), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 This request command sends an "abort" command to the EazyLink Server. The
original PC-LINK II Client sends this command when the user quits the
application.<br>


<br>


 The abort command automatically terminates the EazyLink Server Popdown and
re-activates the previous running resident application in the Z88 operating
system.<br>


<br>


 Before the request command terminates the EazyLink Server, an Escape command
is sent to the EazyLink Client to verify that the command has been
acknowledged.<br>

<b>Sending an Escape character (EazyLink), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 During file transfer from the Z88 or the Client an Escape character sequense
is sent when a true ESC byte needs to be transmitted, and not a request

<pre>                      ESC, ESC                  or 27, 27</pre>


Please note the difference between this ESC sequense for the EazyLink protocol
and the ESC sequense for the PC-LINK II protocol (ESC "B" &lt;HH&gt;).<br>


<br>


The ESC "B" sequense is not recognized in the EazyLink protocol and would

<b>Send files to Client (EazyLink), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 Request for sending Files from Z88 to the Client as specified in the command
header.<br>


<br>


 The request command allows for several files to be sent during the same
command session. Wildcards should be used to specify several files.<br>


<br>


 Please note, that the current translation status reflects the data sent to
Z88. If you chose to activate the []L popdown, the default translation is NONE
with no line feed conversion, ie. every byte sent the Z88 is unaffected. This
is the original state of the PC-LINK II Server popdown.<br>


<br>


 The translation and line feed conversion status may also have been enabled or
disabled using the appropriate request commands. However, this may only be
possible using the EazyLink extended protocol.<br>


<br>


 The EazyLink Client performs a remote activation/de-activation of both the
translation and line-feed conversion to the server before requesting to
transmit or receive files from the server. Translations and line-feed
conversion are determined in the user interface.<br>

<b>Backup files to Client (EazyLink), V4.4</b><br>


<br>


 Request for sending Files from Z88 to the Client as specified in the command
header, but only files which has equal Create and Update Date Stamp (always
set when storing files in Pipedream and other applications). Each file found
with matching date stamps will be sent to the Client, and marked as backup'ed
with setting the file's Update Date Stamp with the current time of the backup.<br>


<br>


 The request command allows for several files to be sent during the same
command session. Wildcards should be used to specify several files.<br>


<br>


 When all appropriate files have been backup'ed, the complete filing system of
the specified backup path is scanned for directories. All found directories are
stored as part of a CLI file that will create the directory structure of the
backup path. The CLI file simulates the commands of the Filer.<br>


<br>


 When the CLI file has been completed by the EazyLink Server it is sent to the
Client as ":RAM.-/Directories.cli". The CLI file has become redundant since all
files sent to the Z88 automatically gets their implicit directory path created
by the EazyLink Server. However, it is still a nice feature if you want to get
your directory structure created at once in another restore situation. Simply
transfer the "Directories.cli" file and execute it in the Filer with the &lt;&gt;EX
command.<br>


<br>


 Depending on the size of the Z88 filing system to be parsed, a fair amount
of time would span between the last file was backup'ed and transmission of the
CLI file. Therefore the Client should wait more than 30 seconds before timing
out to make sure that the CLI may be transferred to the Client as well.<br>


<br>


 Please note, that the current translation status reflects the data sent to
Z88. If you chose to activate the []L popdown, the default translation is NONE
with no line feed conversion, ie. every byte sent the Z88 is unaffected. This
is the original state of the PC-LINK II Server popdown.<br>

<b>Set Z88 System Clock (EazyLink), V4.8</b><br>


<br>


 This request command will set the Z88 system clock to the specified date and
time. The Z88 system call that performs this call takes 1-2 seconds to complete
the task, so it is necessary to specifiy the date/time parameters a few seconds
ahead if the remote computer is going to be precisely synchronized with the
Z88.<br>


<br>


 An ESC "Y" is returned to the Client when the Z88 was successfully initialized
with a new time. If the date/time parameters was defined in the correct format,
an ESC "Z" is returned, indicating failure of setting the Z88 system clock.<br>


<pre>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Client                    Server                Action<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>&lt;ESC "p"&gt;                                       Set Z88 System Clock<br>&lt;System Date&gt;                                   "dd/mm/yyyy"<br>&lt;ESC "N"&gt;&lt;System Time&gt;                          "hh:mm:ss"<br>&lt;ESC "Z"&gt;             -&gt;  waiting<br><br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;ESC "Y"&gt;             Clock was set<br>                                                or<br>waiting               &lt;-  &lt;ESC "Z"&gt;             Illegal date/time parameters.<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>

<b>Get explicit free memory (EazyLink), V5.0</b><br>


<br>


 This request command will return the current free memory of the specified RAM
card on the Z88 (in bytes) to the Client. The figure returned will be
accurate to 256 bytes. The argument is "0" for :RAM.0, "1" for :RAM.1, etc.
Specifying a "-" means :RAM.- (all RAM cards).<br>


<br>


The actual (long integer) number is sent as an Ascii string, eg. "234496" for
229K free memory.<br>
