<BR><B>Introduction<BR><BR></B>First of all, welcome to the OZvm
world! OZvm is a Z88 virtual machine or emulator, using the Java
virtual machine (JVM) to get it running. Java was chosen for its
marvellous cross platform capabilities and to be able to install Java
applications to the Desktop from the web (using the WebStart
feature). OZvm has been born out of the need to debug Z88
applications and to continue development of the Z88 operating system,
&quot;OZ&quot;. All our work with OZvm and new OZ operating system
are freely available under the Gnu Public License, and can be
downloaded from <A HREF="http://z88.sf.net/">http://z88.sf.net</A>.<BR><BR>OZvm
is also an attempt to document the Z88 for historical purposes. Since
this computer is out of production, the company no longer exists,
only a single supplier is available (<A HREF="http://www.rakewell.com/">http://www.rakewell.com</A>),
and probably only a few thousand people still use it actively, it's
about time to establish a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for our beloved
portable before it will be forgotten. Using OZvm, you can have a go
at playing with the computer and it's embedded software, and even
develop new software for it! We have all the tools; cross assembler &amp;
linker, debugging environment (OZvm!) and Eprom blowing hardware (the
Z88!).<BR><BR>Z88 is a lesser known portable made in 1987 by
Cambridge Computer Ltd (CC) in England. CC was established by Sir
Clive Sinclair of ZX Spectrum fame. The computer was sold worldwide,
and has been produced in approx. 30.000 units. Today (2004) maybe a
few thousand users still enjoy using it for their daily tasks. You
can read a lot about the Z88 on Garry Lancasters web site, dedicated
to Z88: <A HREF="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/z88forever/">http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/z88forever/</A>.
There, you will find a lot other other useful links and information.
<BR><BR><BR><B>Requirements</B><BR><BR>OZvm just needs Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) V1.4.x, or if you're going to compile Java programs
your self, the Java Development Kit (JDK) V1.4.x. OZvm does not run
on older versions like V1.3 or less.<BR><BR>If you haven't already
installed it, then grab it from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp</A>.
Please use Sun's installation guides for properly installing and
configuring Java. If you're a Linux user, you can can download an
optimized Java engine with better KDE and Gnome integration at
<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/">http://www.blackdown.org</A>.
Java V1.4.x is bundled with Mac OSX, you lucky guys! There's no Java
V1.4 for Mac OS V9 and earlier; sorry, you can't run OZvm on those
boxes!<BR><BR>OZvm needs approx. a 400Mhz Intel processor to get an
execution speed that matches the look and feel of a real Z88, and
uses about 20Mb RAM when executing (remember, this amount includes
the JVM engine as well). We recommend 128MB RAM computer systems or
more, so that the operating system has resources for other tasks than
just OZvm. Using faster computers just executes the Z88 better.<BR><BR>You
can run OZvm on slower Intel systems. However, the Z80 execution
engine inside OZvm might not perform the speed equivalent of the
original Z80 processor (approx 3.5Mhz) of the real Z88, so you might
experience a &quot;slow&quot; running Z88. We haven't tested OZvm on
other processor architectures like PowerPC (the Mac computers), or
Sun's ALPHA, so we don't know how OZvm performs on those boxes.<BR><BR>OZvm
behaves well in the operating system when running. It typically uses
5% or less processing power of your computer in idle state (waiting
for keyboard input), and 10-20% when processing.<BR><BR><BR><B>Getting
started</B><BR><BR>The easiest way is just to double-click on the
z88.jar file in your favorite File Browser. You usually can do this
since the Java installer makes sure to bind JAR files to the JRE. You
can also start OZvm from the command line shell:</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-left: 1.13cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="monospace">java
-jar z88.jar</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>If you get a &quot;command not found&quot; or
similar error, then you need to configure you PATH environment
variable with the location of the java executable. Please refer to
Sun's installation guide or other README files for your favorite
operating system.<BR><BR>Running OZvm this way will boot a Z88
computer with 32K RAM, using the V4.0 (UK) ROM binary, which was the
latest (and greatest) version that a real Z88 was shipped with in
England around 1989. Important: Since the Z88 boots with an english
ROM, the english (UK) keyboard layout on your PC is necessary,
otherwise the Z88 won't be able to recognize all your keys on the PC
keyboard. If you're using another keyboard layout (especially
french!), you need to change the layout in your operating system,
before getting a sensible input to the Z88.<BR><BR>There's plenty of
command line options available that you can use, for example enable
OZvm in debugging mode (single step through the boot process!),
insert more RAM into the machine and preload it with Application
Cards or File Cards (that conveniently have been stored in .EPR
files). Most of these command line options can be selected from the
program menu as well.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><A NAME="Not_working"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The
following list are the missing functionalities, <SPAN LANG="en-AU">inadequacies</SPAN>
and bugs for OZvm <B><I>V0.3.5</I></B>:</SPAN></P>
<UL>
	<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The
	Square key doesn't always work when running OZvm on Windows. This is
	not a bug, but a side-effect, since the ALT key (that is being used
	for emulating the Square key on the Z88) triggers the Window menu.
	Try press the Down Arrow Key immediately after an ALT key press (and
	release) &ndash; you will see a pop-up menu where you can move or
	resize the window with the keyboard. This problem only happens when
	you single-press the ALT key, and then want to press a letter (a key
	shortcut to activate an application). The shortcut always works in
	OZvm with keeping the ALT key down, then pressing the letter of the
	shortcut.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The
	keyboard emulation cannot always press a certain key combination
	that the Z88 needs. Often is this the case when you PC keyboard uses
	another country-specific layout than what the OZvm expects (ie.
	using a french PC keyboard layout in Microsoft Windows and running
	OZvm with Z88 english V4.0 ROM code that only understands an
	english/american keyboard layout). Always use a keyboard layout on
	your PC that matches the keyboard layout of the Z88. We will
	implement a keyboard below the OZvm screen where you can press those
	special keys using the mouse to click on the &rdquo;key&rdquo;
	buttons.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">There's
	no submenus in main File or Help entries. Sorry, it's still an alpha
	release. There's going to be plenty of Gui features available in
	future releases.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The
	timeout feature of OZ doesn't work. In other words, whatever the
	Panel settings are (from 1 minute onwards), the Z88 doesn't
	automatically switch off.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Alarm
	events never get executed. No reason trying to set an alarm in the
	Alarm popdown. Also, alarms doesn't automtically switch the Z88 on
	when previously (manually) switched off.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">OZvm
	doesn't apparently switch the Z88 properly off. When having pressed
	both SHIFT keys to turn the Z88 off (at least switch the &rdquo;screen&rdquo;
	off), the active screen flickers occasionally through the
	switched-off screen. However, you can easily turn the machine on
	again with both SHIFT keys!</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Eprom
	Programming Hardware is not yet emulated. So you cannot &rdquo;blow&rdquo;
	files to a File Eprom yet in the slot 3.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Flash
	Eprom Programming Hardware is not yet emulated for Rakewell's 1Mb
	Flash Cards. Trying to execute the FlashStore utility will only give
	you a warning that a Flash Eprom is not available in slot 3. You
	will also notice warning messages in the Runtime Window that the
	particular port hasn't been implemented yet.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Serial
	Port emulation is not implemented yet. There's lots of possibilies
	to use this feature to communicate with the outside world (the PC).
	Therefore you cannot use applications that use the serial port; the
	inbuilt VT52 terminal, Ranger's terminal programs &amp; External
	Disk application, PC Link, EazyLink. You will also notice warning
	messages in the Runtime Window that the particular port hasn't been
	implemented yet.</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">The
	Z88 is too fast to play this game!!! Ahh, even the Java engine is
	faster than the original Z88! You   must be having one of those X
	Ghz monster computers! A feature to get the original speed of the
	Z88 running 3.2768 Mhz will be implemented to properly slow down so
	everybody can follow what's going on!</SPAN></P>
