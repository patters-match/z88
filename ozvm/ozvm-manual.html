<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction<br>
<br>
</span>First of all, thanks for downloading OZvm from sourceforge. OZvm
is a
Z88 virtual machine or emulator, using the Java virtual machine (JVM)
to get it running. Java was chosen for its marvellous cross platform
capabilities and to be able to install it to the Desktop from the web
(using the WebStart feature). OZvm has been born out of the need to
debug Z88 applications and to continue development of the Z88 operating
system, "OZ".&nbsp; All out work with OZvm and new OZ operating system
are freely available under the Gnu Public License, and can be
downloaded from <a href="http://z88.sf.net">http://z88.sf.net</a>.<br>
<br>
OZvm is also an attempt to document the Z88 for historical purposes.
Since this computer is out of production, the company no longer exists,
only a single supplier is left (<a href="http://www.rakewell.com">http://www.rakewell.com</a>),
and probably a few thousand people still use it actively, it's about
time to establish a museum for our beloved portable before it will be
forgotten. Using OZvm, you can have a go at playing with the computer
and it's embedded software.<br>
<br>
Z88 is a lesser known portable made in 1987 by Cambridge Computer Ltd
(CC) in England. CC was established by Sir Clive Sinclair of ZX
Spectrum fame. The computer was sold worldwide, and has been produced
approx. in 30.000 units. Today (2004) maybe a few thousand users still
enjoy using it for their daily tasks. You can read a lot about the Z88
on Garry Lancasters web site, dedicated to Z88: <a

There, you will find a lot other other useful links and information. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements<br>
<br>
</span>OZvm needs basically Java Runtime (JRE) V1.4.x. If you haven't
installed <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
