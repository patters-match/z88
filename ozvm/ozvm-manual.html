</span>First of all, thanks for downloading OZvm from sourceforge. OZvm
is a
Z88 virtual machine or emulator, using the Java virtual machine (JVM)
to get it running. Java was chosen for its marvellous cross platform
capabilities and to be able to install Java applications to the Desktop
from the web
(using the WebStart feature). OZvm has been born out of the need to
debug Z88 applications and to continue development of the Z88 operating
system, "OZ".&nbsp; All our work with OZvm and new OZ operating system
are freely available under the Gnu Public License, and can be
downloaded from <a href="http://z88.sf.net">http://z88.sf.net</a>.<br>
<br>
OZvm is also an attempt to document the Z88 for historical purposes.
Since this computer is out of production, the company no longer exists,
only a single supplier is left (<a href="http://www.rakewell.com">http://www.rakewell.com</a>),
and probably only a few thousand people still use it actively, it's
about
time to establish a museum for our beloved portable before it will be
forgotten. Using OZvm, you can have a go at playing with the computer
and it's embedded software, and even develop new software for it! We
have all the tools; cross assembler &amp; linker, debugging environment
(OZvm!) and Eprom blowing hardware (the Z88!).<br>
<br>
Z88 is a lesser known portable made in 1987 by Cambridge Computer Ltd
(CC) in England. CC was established by Sir Clive Sinclair of ZX
Spectrum fame. The computer was sold worldwide, and has been produced
approx. in 30.000 units. Today (2004) maybe a few thousand users still
enjoy using it for their daily tasks. You can read a lot about the Z88
on Garry Lancasters web site, dedicated to Z88: <a
 href="http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/z88forever/">http://www.zxplus3e.plus.com/z88forever/</a>.
There, you will find a lot other other useful links and information. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</span><br>
<br>
OZvm just needs Java Runtime Environment (JRE) V1.4.x, or if
you're going to compile Java programs your self, the Java Development
Kit (JDK) V1.4.x. OZvm does not run on older versions like V1.3 or less.<br>
<br>
If you haven't already installed it, then grab it from <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/index.jsp</a>.
Please use Sun's installation guides for properly installing and
configuring Java. If you're a Linux user, you can can download an
optimized Java engine with better KDE and Gnome integration at <a
 href="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</a>. Java
V1.4.x is bundled with Mac OSX, you lucky guys! There's no Java V1.4
for Mac OS V9 and earlier; sorry, you can't run OZvm on those boxes!<br>
<br>
OZvm needs approx. a 400Mhz Intel processor to get an execution
speed that matches the look and feel of a real Z88, and uses about 20Mb
RAM when executing (remember, this amount includes the JVM engine as
well). We recommend 128MB RAM computer systems or more, so that the
operating system has resources for other tasks than just OZvm. Using
faster computers just executes the Z88 better.<br>
<br>
You can run OZvm on slower Intel systems. However, the Z80 execution
engine inside OZvm might not perform the speed equivalent of the
original Z80 processor (approx 3.5Mhz) of the real Z88, so you might
experience a "slow" running Z88. We haven't tested OZvm on other
processor architectures like PowerPC (the Mac computers), or Sun's
ALPHA, so we don't know how OZvm performs on those boxes.<br>
<br>
OZvm behaves well in the operating system when running. It typically
uses 5% or less processing power of your computer in idle state
(waiting for keyboard input), and 10-20%
when processing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Getting_started"></a>Getting
started</span><br>
<br>
The easiest way is just to double-click on the z88.jar file in your
favorite File Browser. You usually can do this since the Java installer
makes sure to bind JAR files to the JRE. You can also start OZvm from
the command line shell:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">java
-jar z88.jar</span><br>
</div>
<br>
If you get a "command not found" or similar error, then you need to
configure you PATH environment variable with the location of the java
executable. Please refer to Sun's installation guide or other README
files for your favorite operating system.<br>
<br>
Running Ozvm this way will boot a Z88 computer with 32K RAM, using the
V4.0 (UK) ROM binary, which was the latest (and best) version that a
real Z88 was shipped with in England around 1989. <br>
<br>
There's plenty of command line options that you can use to eg. enable
OZvm in debugging mode, insert more RAM into the machine and preload it
with Applications Card or File Cards (that conveniently have been
stored in .EPR files). Most of these command line options can be
selected from the program menu as well.<br>
