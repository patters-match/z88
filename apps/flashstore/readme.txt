FlashStore compilation notes

To compile the FlashStore application, execute the following:

1) Select the directory holding the FlashStore files as the current directory.
2) Execute:
                makeapp.bat

   This will create the executable file "fsapp.bin", "romhdr.bin" and create the "flashstore.epr" card file.
