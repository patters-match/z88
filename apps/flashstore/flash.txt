1M FLASH card

OVERVIEW
Thanks for using the new 1M (1024K) Flash card. Now, you will have a
lot of room to save your files. The Z88 erases the Flash card, you no
longer need an EPROM Eraser.

FAST ERASING - takes less than ten seconds to erase 1024K bytes.
FAST SAVING  - takes three seconds to save a 20K file.
LOW POWER    - takes a tenth of the power used by a standard EPROM.


FLASH CARDS AND EPROMS

Unlike RAM packs, FLASH CARDS AND EPROMS retain their memory even when
power is removed. This makes them the ideal small file backup device
for the Z88.

Individual files do not get deleted on their own. When you save the
same file again to the card, the new file gets saved and the old file
gets marked as deleted. It is still there taking up space and can
be recoved using EP-Fetch2 if required. There is even a 'Erase file
from Card' in FlashStore but again this only marks the file as deleted.
The only way of removing files is by formatting the file area which
removes all the files.


FLASHSTORE APPLICATION

FlashStore is supplied as an Application and is like the Filer (on the
Z88) to save and fetch files.

This introduces a new concept for the Z88. In the past, applications
used to be in a ROM and the files were stored on a separate EPROM.
FlashStore splits the Flash card into two areas.

The ROM area which the Z88 recognises, is where FlashStore and other
applications are stored.

The FILE area (the area that is left over) is where files are stored.
This is the area that gets formatted (erased) when you want to clear
the Flash card. Fortunately the Flash card can be erased in 64K sectors,
allowing applications and files to be on the same device. Where the
split is depends how many applications there are and where the 64K
split line occurs.  This FILE area is calculated by FlashStore when the
Flash card is formatted and is displayed in the right-hand window.

INTEL stopped making Flash EPROM chips which were suitable for the Z88
in 2002 but at the end of 2004 AMD made a simular chip that we could use
if the FlashStore core software was changed.
Gunter Strube re-wrote this program so the Flash card could still be
used on the Z88 and added more features whilst he was at it. After the
INTEL stocks are exhausted, the AMD versions will appear and the only
difference the user will notice is that he can write to or erase the
Flash card in any slot instead of just slot 3.


Forever application bundle

As you would lose 64K's worth of space once FlashStore is on the Flash
card, we have supplied it with Garry Lancaster's compilation FOREVER
and ZIP utilities to use up the spare space.

Details of some of the Applications on Forever and ZIP utilities are:

XYModem

This useful popdown allows you to transfer files (text or binary)
between your Z88 and any other computer using the common Xmodem
protocol, which is available on virtually all computers.

It operates in a similar manner to the built-in Imp-Export utility,
with speeds of up to 19200 baud catered for.

Press C to toggle CRC/Checksum modes, and K to toggle between 128-byte
and 1K block sizes.

You cannot abort a transfer using ESCape, but instead you can
disconnect the cable and wait for a timeout to occur.

EP-Fetch2 - new version

The version of EP-Fetch on this ROM has been specially modified to
allow it to work with all sizes of EPROMs in any slot (1-3), including
the new Flash cards.

It can also read files from combined ROM/EPROM cards created with the
latest version of the RomCombiner program.

New features have been added including printing filenames to a printer.
See whatsnew.txt for more details.

FreeRam

FreeRam is a popdown which instantly displays the amount of memory
available in the default RAM device, together with a graphical map
showing exactly where the free and used memory areas are located.

Press a number key (0-3) to view the RAM device (:RAM.0 to :RAM.3) of
your choice.

Alarmsafe

AlarmSafe is a popdown which allows you to save all your current alarms
to a datafile for backup purposes. If you need to reset your Z88 for
any reason, you can then simply load the datafile back into AlarmSafe
which will automatically set all the alarms back up again.

Lockup

Lockup is a popdown giving your Z88 an elementary level of security,
which can only be circumvented by resetting the machine.

After activating the popdown, type a password (twice for confirmation)
and then press the ESC key to switch the Z88 off. When the Z88 is
turned back on, you must re-enter the password correctly before you can
cancel the popdown (again using ESC).

When entering passwords,every single key (including special keys like
SHIFT and the square and diamond keys) counts as part of the password -
only the ESC, DEL and ENTER keys cannot be included. Passwords can be
up to 16 keystrokes long.

Installer

Installer allows you to run true Z88 applications from free RAM in your
machine, rather than requiring them to be blown to EPROMs or cards.
This makes it ideal for trying out new applications, or if you have no
ROM-creating facility. It is also very useful for developers, who can
test software in a fraction of the usual time.

Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popdown which runs automatically after every reset. It
acts in a similar way to the built-in facility where a file called
"boot.cli" on an EPROM or card in slot 3 is automatically executed
after a reset.

However, Bootstrap is much more flexible and after a reset will execute
a CLI file called "bootstrap.cli" which can be located:

in any directory of ay device (eg :RAM.1/system/bootstrap.cli)

on any EPROM, Flash card or ROM/EPROM (created by RomCombiner) card in
any slot, 1 to 3

This means that you can have different boot routines depending on
whether the Z88 does a hard or soft reset: keep the soft reset version
in RAM, and the hard reset version on EPROM or card.

Note that EPROM or card files must not contain any directory names (ie
just /bootstrap.cli is accepted).

Instructions on how to use the other programs are in the zipped file.
Load them into PipeDream to read and print them. The file extensions
are .pdd.

The FlashStore application should you want to use it.

ROMCOMBINER.zip allows you to add any applications you may have to the
Flash card.

All files supplied are either zipped (.ZIP), Plain Text (.TXT) or in
PipeDream (.PDD) format.  They are as follows:-

ROMCOMBINER.ZIP     Adds Applications you already have
FLASHSTORE.ZIP      The Application of FlashStore
INSTALLER.TXT       Installer instructions
WHATSNEW.TXT        Whats new in Forever
XYMODEM.TXT         XY-Modem instructions
UNZIP.TXT           Unzip Instructions
ZIPUP.TXT           Zip up instructions
FLASH.TXT           This file

Please take this opportunity to MAKE A COPY of these files before
reformatting the FILE AREA. Save them to another computer or to another
EPROM or card.

Rakewell will charge users who lose these files and require another
copy but the good news is that they can be downloaded from our web
site.

Fetching Files

Although there is a Fetch file command in FlashStore, you can also use
EP-Fetch2, which is a 'point and shoot' program. You can also fetch
'deleted' files with this application.

Fetching all Files

Don't forget the RESTORE function. Sometimes it is easier to fetch all
the files and delete a few unwanted files afterwards.

Using two Flash cards

USING TWO FLASH CARDS AT THE SAME TIME

You can have your Applications (including FlashStore) in slot 2 and
read any of your "master" files from there, whilst using the another
Flash card in slot 3 for current files.

To use two Flash cards first prepare the Flash card which you want to
use in slot 2, with your master files. This is done by using it in slot
3 to save your files first. You may elect to ZIP these files up
beforehand (to save space).

When moving the Flash card from Slot 3 to 2, follow the rules on
removing and inserting Applications. These are:-

Go into the INDEX and check you are not running any of the applications
on the ROM. If (for example) the Flash card is in slot 3, a number '3'
would be indicated in the CARDS column on the right-hand side of the
display.

If you are, move the cursor over the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES and use the
<>KILL command to close it.

Open the card flap (the Z88 should beeb) and remove the Flash card.

Close the flap (the Z88 should beeb again) and check that the INDEX
flag has not appeared. This should not be displayed on the top
right-hand corner.

Open the card flap (the Z88 should beeb yet again) and put the Flash
card in slot 2.

Close the flap and check that the Applications appear again in the list
on the left-hand side.

Don't be temped to put the Flash card out of one slot and into another
without shutting the flap in-between times. The Index application manager
needs to update it's external application list and therefore needs
closing of the flap after a card removal.

On the 2nd Flash card, you may want to clear the Application area to
give the full 1024K space for files. You only need one copy of
FlashStore, which, in this example is in slot 2. Use the Flash card
block erase command in RomCombiner to do this.

You can only Save Files and Format the INTEL Flash card when it is in
slot 3.


RUNNING THE APPLICATION

To start the application either move the cursor down to the FlashStore
(the application name in the command window in the Index) or start it
with []J

The three windows are:=

The command window - selects the mostly used commands
The action window - shows you what flashstore is doing
The information window - displays the chip type, file area, bytes free,
files saved and deleted.


COMMANDS

You have ten commands. They are selected using

     the MENU using cursor keys and the ENTER key
or   using the <> key command sequence (useful for .cli files)
or   use the quick command window - seven quick access useful commands
     are here using cursor keys and the ENTER key.

<> KEYS            DESCRIPTION

<>CE or   <>CF     Catalogue Files
<>SC               Select Card
<>ES or   <>FS     Save to Card
<>EF or   <>FL     Fetch from Card
<>BF               Backup from RAM
<>RF               Restore to RAM
<>SV               Default RAM
<>ER or   <>FE     Erase file from Card
<>FFA              Format File Area
<>ABOUT            About FlashStore
-ESC-              Quits this application


Notes

The current Device and Directory (as selected by the Panel and the
Filer) will be displayed on the command line with the Save and Restore
commands.

If the Z88's battery is low, you will not be able to FORMAT or SAVE
files. This is a safety feature.

Before formatting make sure you have saved and have a copy of the files
supplied! (See Format) After formatting, you will have the unused space
for saving your files.

If the card you have selected does not support any of the commands due
to slot position or type, that command will be greyed out.


Catalogue Files

This command lists all the files in the Flash File Card. You have a
choice whether to show deleted files or not. Deleted files are grayed
and 'd' letter appears. On the right of the window you can see the size
of the file.


Select Card

This allows multiple Flash cards and EPROMs to be read using the same
FlashStore application. Highlight the Slot number (1, 2 or 3) with the
cursor that you wish to use. You may also press digits '1', '2' or '3'
to select the actual slot. The selected device will be displayed at the
top of the right-hand window with the file information with current
information of file data and space left on the card.


Save to Card

Wildcards are allowed,
Filename:  :RAM.1

You simply have to enter the filename. Always specify the device. You
are allowed to use wildcards. For example, if you want to save all the
files including sub-directories, in RAM.1, type :RAM.1//*.

When files are saved, the file size is shown together with the
"header," the amount of space needed for the filename to be stored on
the Flash File card. The program checks the data being saved is
correct. In the unlikely event of an error, a message will be displayed
and the file will be saved again. When the 'no room' message is
displayed, the last filename that was trying to be saved can be viewed
after pressing the ESC key.


Fetch from Card

Enter exact filename (no wildcard).
Filename:
You have to enter the exact filename, preceded with the slash (/).
Wildcards are not allowed.
Fetch as : /                      [The slash is already there]
Overwrite existing file : Yes     [Yes overwrites, No doesn't]
Fetching...  Done.                [The file has been fetched]
Completed                         [The Fetch command is finished]
Press ESC to Resume               [ESC returns to Main Menu]


Backup from RAM

This backs up all the files (until the flash card is full) in your
current RAM device. Instructions on changing the device are given on
the screen.


Restore to RAM

All files (including sub-directories) on the Flash card are fetched
using the sub-menu commands. You might choose to restore all files
without checking for existing files. Directories are created
automatically in your selected RAM device.

Enter Device (or path),
Device :RAM.1                     [Change RAM device and/or path]
Overwrite existing RAM files? No  [Will prompt user to overwrite file]
Fetching file to :RAM.1/filename
Overwrite existing file : Yes     [Yes overwrites, No doesn't]
Fetching...  Done.                [The file has been fetched]
Completed                         [The Restore command is finished]
Press SPACE to Resume             [SPACE returns to Main Menu]


Default RAM

FlashStore by default uses the RAM device that is the Default device
set in the Panel []S. This can be changed for this session only, using
this command. Instructions on changing the device are given on the
screen.


Erase file from Card

Although files cannot be deleted from the flash card to gain space,
this command allows a single file to be marked as deleted. This is
useful for getting rid of those obsolete files that do not get
overwritten.

Format File Area

This erases the File Area of the Flash card and formats it. If you have
two flash cards that can be formatted you will be invited to choose
which one you want to format..

When the command is executed, it says:

CAUTION! All data will be lost.
Are you really sure? No          [Yes formats, No returns Main Menu]

FAQ

1)   Do I need to format the EPROM before I can start saving files
     to it?

No. You will notice that there are some files that have been included
on the Flash EPROM that you may find useful. One of these files is this
User Guide. Use the Catalogue files to see what there is.

2)   Does the format only wipe out the text files? i.e. does
     formatting leave the 64K of applications untouched?

Only the file area is formatted. Applications remain on the Flash card.

3)   When I FETCH something from the Flash card, where am I
     fetching it to?

To the default RAM device as set on the Panel []S or to the Default RAM
device set by this application.

4)   Is this the same as loading a file into Pipedream?
     i.e. I can FETCH my documents from the EPROM?

You need to use the RAM device as an intermediate device when either
fetching or saving files.

5)   Can I EXPORT files from the EPROM directly to my PC or do I
     have to load them into :RAM.0 or :RAM.1 first?

No See above.
