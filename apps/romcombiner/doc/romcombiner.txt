Introduction
============
RomCombiner is a BASIC program which allows you to combine several ROM
images onto a single card, thus enabling you to use many applications
from a single large (eg 128K or 256K) ROM, instead of having to
continually swap cards. With the new Flash Cards, you could fit just
about every application ever written for the Z88 onto a single card!

Another feature of RomCombiner is that it allows you to modify the
letter key assigned to a particular application, change an
application's name, alter the order that applications appear in the
Index, or even leave out an unwanted application from the Index.

The program also includes facilites for reading ROM images, and for
programming standard EPROMs and Flash Cards, and erasing Flash Cards.

The latest version of RomCombiner and other free Z88 software is always
available from the Z88 Forever! website.


Using the program
=================
RomCombiner is a collection of three files: 'romcombiner.bas', 
'romutil.bas' and 'romcombiner.bin'. Load all three files into your
Z88 in the same directory, start a BBC BASIC application with #B and
RUN "ROMCOMBINER.BAS".

The main menu provides eight options, allowing you to create image
files from a ROM in the Z88, combine one or more sets of images, and
program a blank EPROM with a set of images. You can also check EPROMs
are properly erased, convert emulator files, erase Flash Cards, change
the "wait" mode, and exit the program.


Read ROM card to image files
============================
Upon selecting this option, you are asked for the slot containing the
ROM you want to make image files from, and a name for the card (this
can be up to 12 characters long).

Usually, you should type "F" to create images of the full ROM card; in
this case, the program will detect the size of the card and create the
appropriate number of images. For example, if you have the PCLink 2 ROM
in slot 2 and answered "2" for the slot number and "pclink" for the
card name, the program will create images called pclink.63 and
pclink.62.

Advanced users may like to choose to take an image of a single bank, or
range of banks, from a card.


Combine image files of cards
============================
When you have got all the images of the cards you wish to combine,
select the "combine" option. This presents you with a further menu
of choices.

The first thing to do is Add a card to the ROM you are creating: just
enter A and you will then be asked for the name of a card to add. This
should be entered without an extension - for example, if your images
are called pclink.63 and pclink.62, you should just enter pclink.

After successfully adding a card, the display will show the total
number of cards, applications and the total ROM size of the new card.
As well as this, there is some information about each application
found. eg.
	2. L=PCLink (4)
This shows that PCLink is application number 2, and will be accessed
with key L. The number in brackets shows the order that the application
will appear in the Index list (ie 4th on this card).

At this point you can add further cards, or alter the details of the
applications loaded so far.

Key
---
This option lets you specify a different letter for the application to
be called by. This is useful if you have several applications using the
same key. If, for example, you had three applications using key W, then
only the first would be accessed with []W, the second with []ZW and the
third with []ZZW. So, it might be better to assign an unused letter to
one of the applications.

You can also choose 0 in this option, in which case the application
will not be given a hotkey, but must be selected from the Index menu.

Order
-----
This lets you change the order of the application list in the Index.
You can enter an application number and a new position for it (entering
0 for the position will leave it out of the application list
altogether).

Alternatively, press ENTER, and then enter the numbers of the
applications in the order you wish them to appear in the Index. Press
ENTER again when you've listed all the applications you want; any you
have not specified will be left out of the Index list.

Leaving applications out of the Index list can be useful if there is an
application you never need present on one of your cards (for example,
Diskfiler 2 if you do not have a disk drive!). However, note that doing
this does not actually save any space on the new card.

Rename
------
This lets you change the name of an application. The new name must
be the same length or shorter than the original one.

Patch
-----
Some applications are written expecting to be located in specific
banks in a certain-sized cards, and do not usually work correctly after
being "combined" into a larger card. This option allows you to select a
patch file designed to correct this behaviour for a particular
application, and so allow it to be used in combined cards.

If you find an application which does not work properly in a combined
card, you should check if a patch file is available for it. Some patch
files are included with this release of RomCombiner, but there may be
others available. These can always be obtained from the Z88 Forever!
website.

To use a patch, simply use this option and type in its filename. The
patch will then be applied during generation of the new card. Any
application which has a patch assigned to it is marked with an asterisk
(*) in the list. To remove a patch from an application, just press
ENTER when asked for the filename.

When combining a card with a patch, you may see some warnings displayed.
This could mean you have the wrong patch selected for the application (in
which case the application probably won't work correctly). However, it's
more likely that the application has been patched previously when combined
into another card - in this case the warnings can be ignored.

Info
----
This displays technical information on the selected application for
advanced users.

Disp
----
This toggles the display mode. When on, you will always see a list of
the current applications on the combined card. However, if this list
becomes too long, you may prefer to turn it off with this option.

Wait
----
This toggles the wait mode (you can also do this from the main menu).
If "Wait mode" is on, the program will tell you whenever it needs to
load a new image file, and whenever it has saved an amended copy of an
image file. This is useful if you do not have enough memory on your Z88
to hold all the ROM images at once; at these pauses you can transfer
files between the Z88 and another computer, ensuring that the program
always has access to the files it needs.

Techy
-----
Another set of options for advanced users. They allow you to:

1. Alter the ID of the card being created
2. Set the last application to point to another bank and address,
instead of an end-of-list marker
3. Force the card to have a particular size, instead of the calculated one
4. Create images starting from a bank other than 63
5. Enable an EPROM filing system on the card (see later for details)

The main use for these options is to allow you to create very large ROM
cards in two or more stages, without having to set the wait mode on.

Save
----
This option saves all the details of the ROM you are currently
creating. This is useful when you are making a lot of changes or adding
a lot of cards, since if something goes wrong you can simply re-start
the program and Load the configuration up again. You might also like
to save the configuration of a ROM you are creating, so that if you
want to make changes at a later date you don't have to start from
scratch.

Load
----
Re-loads a previously saved configuration.

Create
------
Once you have added all the cards you require, and are satisfied with
the application list, press C to finish and create the final images.

First enter a name for the new card (again with no extension). This
will be used to create images called CARDNAME.63 etc down to the lowest
bank in the card.

Unless you have lots of free memory, you should answer Y to the next
question; this deletes the original images as it creates the new ones,
to preserve memory.

Then the program will create the new card images. This can take a long
time!

Quit
----
This aborts the combination process and returns you to the main menu.


Verify EPROM banks properly erased
==================================
If you're unsure whether your EPROMs are being properly erased (perhaps
you have problems blowing ROMs to them), this option allows you to
check whether they are ready to program.

Usually, you should press F to check a full EPROM, and enter the size of
the card. Alternatively, you can enter a range of banks; use the same
number for both if you only want to check one bank.

If you do have problems with EPROMs that you can't seem to erase, try
tapping the card sharply on a hard surface and then re-erase it. This
will dislodge any particles which may be on the window and preventing
the UV light from reaching the chip.


Blow image files to blank EPROM
===============================
This main menu option allows you to create a ROM on a totally blank
EPROM in slot 3 (it must not have been catalogued by Filer).

After entering the EPROM type and the card name, press F to
automatically blow all the images in the card. Once this is completed,
you should go to the Index, remove the card, close the flap and then
re-insert the card again to properly initialise the application list.

Advanced users can choose to blow a range of banks to the EPROM.

Note that this option will refuse to write any bytes if the batteries
are low, to ensure EPROM integrity.


Flash Card block erase
=======================
This option allows you to erase blocks of your Flash Cards (in slot
3), either individually or all at once.

Enter the block number (1-16 for 1Mb Flash Cards) or 256 to erase the
entire card.

Each "block" is the smallest unit of a Flash Card which can be erased,
and consists of 4x16K banks. They are arranged as follows:

	Block	Banks
	1	0 to 3
	2	4 to 7
	3	8 to 11
	4	12 to 15
	5	16 to 19
	6	20 to 23
	7	24 to 27
	8	28 to 31
	9	32 to 35
	10	36 to 39
	11	40 to 43
	12	44 to 47
	13	48 to 51
	14	52 to 55
	15	56 to 59
	16	60 to 63


Emulator file conversion
========================
This option allows you to convert between the bank files used within
this program (eg name.62, name.63 etc) and the name.epr files used by
the Z88 emulators.

Simply enter the name of a file to convert (without any extension). If
an .EPR file of that name is found, it will be converted to individual
bank files which can be worked on by this program. If a .63 file of the
name given is found instead, then a .EPR file will be created, which
can be used by Z88 emulators.


Adding an EPROM filing system to your card
==========================================
It is now possible to add files to your application cards. This is not
an automatic process, but it is well worth the effort to create a card
containing both your favourite applications and most important
non-changing files (such as BASIC programs that you always require).

If you have a Flash Card, do *not* follow this procedure. It is much
easier to create a ROM on the Flash card in the normal way, and then use
FlashStore to format the remaining space for use with files. This also
gives much more flexibility, as you can save files at any time, and even
re-format the file area.

If you wish to add files to an ordinary 128K or 256K EPROM, however, this
is the only way to do it...

Files can only be added to the card during the creation process; there
is no way to save additional files. In addition, the Filer and other
EPROM-handling programs cannot read files from these special combined
ROM/EPROM cards.

There is a modified version of the EP-Fetch application now available
on the Z88 Forever application card which can handle reading of files
from any EPROM (including Flash Cards) or ROM/EPROM card in any slot
of the Z88. I suggest that you include the Z88 Forever card in any
combined card you make, so that you can always retrieve files from it.

There are several stages to adding files to your card:

1. Save the files you require to an ordinary (blank) EPROM.
2. Work out how many banks of your EPROM are in use. This can be done
   by dividing the size reported by EP-Fetch by 16384 and rounding up.
   eg. If EP-Fetch reports 26712 bytes used, then 26712/16384=1.63
       Therefore, 2 banks are in use.
3. Use the [R]ead option to read the required banks from the EPROM
   card. The banks you need are numbered upwards from 0. For example,
   if 5 banks are in use you would read banks 0 to 4.
4. Use the [B]low option to blow these banks to your new card.
5. Use the [C]ombine option to generate the ROM images you need.
   Before selecting [C]reate, use the [T]echy options and set the
   EPROM filing system option.
6. Finally, [B]low the ROM images to your card.

Don't forget that the size of your ROM images plus the size of your
EPROM files cannot exceed the total physical card size!


Known problems
==============
You should be careful not to use your new combined ROM at the same time
as the original ROMs. This is because the new ROM will have the same ID
as the first card that you entered, and this sort of thing confuses OZ
no end! To avoid this, you could alter the Card ID (in [T]echy options)
manually.

If you find an application that does not work as expected in a combined
card, there are three main courses of action you can take:

1. Check if a patch file is available for the application
2. Try re-creating the ROM, with the problem application as the first
card to be added to the ROM
3. Contact me to discuss a possible solution

Finally, application cards cannot use bank 0, as the Z88 operating
system uses this value to signify "no bank". Thus the largest possible
application card is 1008K (using banks 1 to 63).
