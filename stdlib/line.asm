;    Draw a pixel line from (x0,y0) defined (H,L) - the starting point coordinate,
;    to the end point (x1,y1).

;    Design & programming by Gunther Strube, Copyright (C) InterLogic 1995
;
;    The routine checks the range of specified coordinates which is the boundaries
;    of the graphics area (256x64 pixels).
;    If a boundary error occurs the routine exits automatically. This may be
;    useful if you are trying to draw a line longer than allowed or outside the
;    graphics borders. Only the visible part will be drawn.
;
;    The coordinate system is defined by the plot routines which defines the
;    standard origin (0,0) at the bottom left corner and (255,63) as the top
;    right corner.
;    However, the hardware graphics memory is organized as (0,0) in the top
;    left corner and (255,63) as the bottom right corner. The plot routines
;    adjusts for this automatically.
;
;    The plot routine is defined by an address pointer in IX.
;    This routine converts the absolute coordinates to a relative distance as (dx,dy)
;    defining (COORDS) with (x0,y0) and a distance in (dx,dy). The drawing is then
;    executed by Line_r .
;
;    IN:  HL = (x0,y0) - x0 range is 0 to 255, y0 range is 0 to 63.
;         DE = (x1,y1) - x1 range is 0 to 255, y1 range is 0 to 63.
;         IX = pointer to plot routine that uses HL = (x,y) of plot coordinate.
;
;    OUT: None.
