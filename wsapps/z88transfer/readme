Z88transfer v3.1

To install Z88transfer on Linux, just run the script
'install.sh' as root ('sudo ./install.sh').

You can run Z88Transfer from the same directory, without
installing it in your system ('./z88transfer.py').

For windows, install first all the required runtime files (see
the documentation), and then run 'z88transfer.py'.

You have full documentation (in HTML format) in the DOCS folder, or
(after installation on Linux) at /usr/share/doc/z88transfer.
