<h1>Z88transfer: a transfer utility for Linux (and windows) and Cambridge Computers Z88</h1>
</div>
<p></p>


<p>Current version: 2.3</p>


<p></p>
<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
Z88transfer is a graphical utility to transfer files between a PC and a
Z88, an old but great 8-bit portable computer from Clive Sinclair (but
if you downloaded this program, you should already know it).
Z88transfer has been written in Python and uses PyGTK. It was
originally designed to work under Linux, but now it also works under
Windows. It should work fine under MacOS X with very little (if any)
modifications.

<p>It's main advantage over other programs is that it can import and
export transparently from Abiword to Pipedream, and vice-versa, during
the transfer itself. This is: if you send an Abiword file from your PC,
your Z88 will receive it converted to PipeDream format, and if you send
a PipeDream file from your Z88, your PC will receive it converted to
Abiword format. This allows you to work directly with all your files,
without worrying about having to convert it to and from PipeDream
format.</p>


<p>It can emulate foreign characters (like &aacute;, &ntilde; and so
on) from an english keyboard too, and convert them into true characters
when the file is exported to Abiword. This is called
"Pseudotranslation".</p>

<p></p>
<h2>INSTALLING Z88TRANSFER</h2>
There are three possibilities: System-wide linux installation, local linux installation, and windows installation

<p></p>
<h3>Linux installation</h3>
To be able to run Z88transfer, you must have installed in your computer:
<ul>

  <li>The Python interpreter</li>

  <li>The GTK and PyGTK libraries</li>

  <li>The libglade library</li>

  <li>The PySerial library</li>

</ul>
All theses components are GPL, so it's very probable that you can find
them in your Linux's installation CDs. Just be sure that all are
installed, and go ahead, or simply try to run Z88transfer from a
command line, and, if something isn't installed, you will receive an
explanatory error.

<p>To install the program itself in the system, just enter as root and run the script file <b>install.sh</b>.
This will create the directories and copy all the files in the right
place. It should create even an entry in your
Gnome/KDE/freedesktop-compatible-windowmanager menu.</p>


<p>You can install Z88Transfer in your HOME folder too (this is useful
when you want to use Z88Transfer in a computer without root access). To
do this, just run the script file <b>install-local.sh</b>. This script will install Z88Transfer in your HOME directory, under the directory <b>~/.bin</b>, and will put all the documentation under the directory <b>~/.bin/doc</b>. To run the program, you must use the <b>local</b> parameter, like this:</p>

<p align="center">~/.bin/z88transfer.py local</p>


<p></p>
<h3>Windows installation</h3>
To be able to run z88transfer under windows, you must install some
components in your system. This is the list, with the internet URL
where you can download them. You must install them in this order.
<ul>

</ul>
<ol>
  <li>The Python interpreter <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">(http://www.python.org/download/)</a></li>
  <li>GTK for Windows <a href="http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/">http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/</a></li>
  <li>PyGTK for windows <a href="http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/%7Egustin/win32_ports/pygtk.html">(http://www.pcpm.ucl.ac.be/~gustin/win32_ports/pygtk.html</a>, or search for "PyGTK windows" with google).</li>
  <li>PyWin32 component <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">(http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)</a>.</li>
  <li>PySerial for windows <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyserial/</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>

</ul>
After installing all these components, just run the BAT script file <b>install-windows.bat</b>,
followed by the drive letter where you want to install Z88Transfer.
Example: if you want to install it in the drive C, just run:
<p align="center">install-windows.bat C:</p>

<p>You will find all the files at <b>&lt;drive-letter&gt;:\z88transfer</b>. To run the program, just use the Z88TRANSFER.BAT file. You can create a link at your desktop.

<p>You can launch z88transfer from a command line just this way, too:</p>
<p><center>&lt;drive-letter&gt;:\z88transfer\z88transfer.py windows</center></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Description of the interface</h2>
When you launch Z88transfer, you will see a window like this:
<p></p>
<center><img src="main_window.png"></center>
<p></p>

<p>This window is divided in these parts:</p>

<p></p>
<center><img src="main_window2.png"></center>
<p></p>

<p><b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are the file lists. In <b>1</b> we can see the files in the Z88, and in <b>2</b>
the files in the PC. Directories ends with a slash ('/'). You can
navigate through&nbsp;the file tree just clicking in the directories to
go down in the tree, and clicking in the <em>../</em> to go up.</p>

<p><b>3</b> is the <em>reload</em> button. Clicking on it will re-read
the files from the Z88 and the local disk. It's usefull when you launch
Z88transfer before than the <b>PCLINK</b> or <b>EAZYLINK</b> utilities and <b>1</b> appears blank.</p>

<p><b>4</b> are the transfer buttons. If you select a file in <b>1</b> and press the right arrow, the file will be transferred from the Z88 to the PC. The same, if you select a file in <b>2</b>
and press the left arrow, that file will be transferred from the PC to
the Z88. If there's a file with the same name at the destination
directory, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it or abort the
transfer (except if you are using the IMP-EXPORT protocol).</p>

<p><b>5</b> is the status bar. It shows the current activity. If you
are transferring a file, you will see there how many bytes has been
sent.</p>

<p><b>6</b> shows the current configuration (serial port, speed and protocol). You can change it by pressing the button <b>9</b>. Your new preferences will be stored in your hard disk.</p>

<p><b>7</b> allows you to set the Z88's clock. It will use your PC's
clock as reference, so be sure that it's adjusted (you can use a NTP
server to sinchronize your PC's clock with an official atomic clock).
This option is available only if you select <b>EazyLink</b> protocol.</p>

<p><b>8</b> shows the (aproximate) free memory available in your Z88. This option is available only if you select <b>EazyLink</b> protocol.</p>

<p><b>10</b> allows you to create a new folder, rename a file or
folder, or delete a file or folder in your Z88. This option is
available only if you select <b>EazyLink</b> protocol.</p>


<p></p>
<h2>Configuring</h2>
The first thing you must do is to configure Z88transfer. To do so, just run it and press the "Preferences" icon (button <b>9</b>). Doing so will show this window:
<p></p>
<center><img src="config_window.png"></center>
<p></p>

<p>There you can choose:</p>


<p></p>
<h3>Communications</h3>
Here you have all about physical ports and protocols:
<ul>

  <li><b>The serial port</b>: default is "/dev/ttyS0" (COM1 in
Windows), but you can put the one you want (/dev/ttyS1 for COM2 in
Windows, or /dev/usb/ttyS0 for the first USB&lt;-&gt;serial adapter).</li>

  <li><b>The interface speed</b>: you can choose 2400, 9600, 19200 or 38400.</li>

  <li><b>The transfer protocol</b>: you can choose between IMP-EXPORT
(the Z88's original transfer protocol. But read the notes about it),
PCLINK, the protocol for the PCLINK program, or EAZYLINK, if you have
an EPROM with it.</li>

</ul>


<p>Remember that, currently, only IMP-EXPORT program allows to choose
the speed. Both PCLINK and EAZYLINK works always at 9600 bps, so if you
use that utilities, be sure to choose that speed or the program will
not work. Remember too that there seems to be problems with speeds
faster than 9600bps due to OZ (the Z88 operating system) not being fast
enough to handle the raw transfer speed - so until there's a fix, or
the communication program explicitly says that it supports them,
connect only at 9600 or 2400bps.</p>


<p></p>
<h3>Translation</h3>
Here you have the options for automagic import and export features.
<ul>

  <li><b>Automatic conversion from/to Abiword</b>: if you check this
button, everytime you send from your PC a file with an .ABW extension,
Z88transfer will export it from Abiword to Pipedream format, and rename
it with .PDD extension in the Z88 (the file in the PC remains intact,
of course). And everytime you send from your Z88 a file with an .PDD or
.PPD extension, Z88transfer will export it from PipeDream to Abiword
format and rename it with .ABW extension (and, of course, the original
file in the Z88 remains intact).</li>

  <li><b>Automatic conversion from/to RTF</b>: if you check this
button, everytime you send from your PC a file with an .RTF extension,
Z88transfer will export it from RTF to Pipedream format, and rename it
with .PDD extension in the Z88. The same when you send from the Z88 a
file with a .PDD or .PPD extension. RTF is an open document format
recognized by nearly all current text processors (like Abiword,
Koffice, OpenOffice and Microsoft Word).</li>

  <li><b>Pseudotranslation</b>: this option allows to work with foreign characters in Z88s with english ROMs and keyboards. The trick consists in using the <b>'</b> character as a prefix to emulate them. By default, Z88transfer works whit this set:</li>
</ul>

<table align="center">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Z88</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>PC</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'a</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&aacute;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'e</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&eacute;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'i</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&iacute;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'o</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&oacute;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'u</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&uacute;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'n</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&ntilde;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'?</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&iquest;</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>'!</td>
      <td>&nbsp;&lt;-&gt;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&iexcl;</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This set is fine for spanish characters. Of course, you can adapt
this set for your personal needs, just creating a file with the new
rules and choosing it with the <b>File with rules for Pseudotranslation</b> button.</p>

<p>This file has a very simple format: each line contains two
characters: the first is the ASCII character that, prefixed with a ',
will be converted to the second UNICODE character. Let's see it with an
example: the this is default file that gives us the above spanish
translation scheme:</p>

<p align="center">a&aacute;<br>

e&eacute;<br>

i&iacute;<br>

o&oacute;<br>

u&uacute;<br>

n&ntilde;<br>

?&iquest;<br>

!&iexcl;</p>

<p>This file is stored by default at <i>/usr/share/z88transfer/pseudotranslation</i>, but you can change the location.</p>

<p>With this mode active, to type a "'" character, just use it twice
(this is, just press "''"). Really, prefixed characters not included in
the table will be shown "as is", so if you write 'W at the Z88, you
will get W at Abiword.</p>



<p>If this option isn't selected, then Z88transfer will simply convert
between Latin1 codes (used on Z88) and UTF-8 (used on Abiword).</p>


<p>It's important to note that the pseudotranslation is done ONLY with
AbiWord/RTF/PipeDream files, and ONLY if the automagic conversion is
active.</p>


<p></p>
<h3>Some details about the ABIWORD/RTF&lt;-&gt;PIPEDREAM conversion</h3>
The import and export functions are limited to theses capabilities:
<ul>

  <li>Bold, italic and underline fonts (you can combine them, using bold and italic, or bold and underline...)</li>

  <li>Page breaks</li>

  <li>Left, center and right alignment</li>

</ul>


<p>Another important detail is that, since PipeDream adds a Carriage
Return after each line, the converter will asume that all lines with
only one Carriage Return at its end forms a single paragraph, so to
delimite a paragraph from the next one you must use two carriage
return. The converter will ignore extra carriage returns, so is the
same to put two, three or one hundred: it will asume there is TWO
carriage returns and will delete the other 98. It will delete the
spaces at the begining of each paragraph too.</p>


<p></p>
<h3>Some details about the IMP-EXPORT transfer</h3>
IMP-EXPORT protocol is very simple, so the options for using it are
very limited. When using IMP-EXPORT you won't be able to see in <b>1</b>
the current files in your Z88. To transfer a file from the Z88 to the
PC you must press first the right arrow, and then choose the option <b>Send file</b>
in your Z88. You have 30 seconds before Z88transfer aborts. You will
not be warned if there's a file in the PC with the same name, so be
carefull.
<p>Sending files to the Z88 is the same: just choose first <b>receive file</b> in your Z88, when asked for the filename press <b>Return</b>, and then select the file in <b>2</b>
and press the left arrow. The file will be transferred to the Z88 and,
if there was another file with the same name, it will be overwritten.</p>

<p>The files in this mode are stored in the default device (you can change it in the <b>panel</b>, in your Z88).</p>


<p></p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<b>The program doesn't work. What's happening?</b>
<p>Be sure that you have all the modules needed: Python, PyGTK, GTK and GDK, libglade and PySerial. The same for windows.</p>

<p>If the program runs, but you are unable to connect to your Z88,
check that you have access to your serial ports. Normally, you will
have to add your user to the serial-port group (the exact group's name
should be <b>dialout</b>, at least in Debian).</p>

<p>Finally, be sure that you are launching Z88Transfer with the right parameters. You MUST put <b>local</b> after the command if you have installed Z88Transfer locally under Linux, or <b>windows</b> if you are using Z88Transfer under Microsoft Windows.</p>


<p></p>
