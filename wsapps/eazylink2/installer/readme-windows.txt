Welcome to EazyLink II V1.0 on your favorite desktop!

The Z88 Team is very proud to present to you the first
application to transfer files to your beloved Cambridge Z88
that is available on three desktop operating systems
simultaneously.

This is our first public test release, Beta 1.

It is very stable, and have been tested on multiple Linux,
Windows and Mac OSX platforms. However, we need feedback and
more end-user testing, so we can launch V1.0 with great pride.

Please, sign up with an account on our project (all our work
is open source), and provide any feedback you may have
(ideas, bug reports, etc):

(to see our general news about the Z88 project)

We have developed the EazyLink application using Qt, a cross-
platform application development toolkit, available for
Linux, Windows & Mac OSX. The Installer you have been using
is Bitrock's InstallerBuilder, also generating multiplatform
application installers.

This application is designed to work optimally using the
Z88 Eazylink Popdown V5.2 or later. This popdown must be
installed on an application card, inserted into one of the
external slots of your Cambridge Z88. Copy this link into
your browser to download a free copy and follow instructions:

The Eazylink II Desktop Client is also designed to transfer
files to your Z88 using the built-in Imp/Export popdown, in
case you don't yet have the Eazylink popdown installed on
your Z88.
