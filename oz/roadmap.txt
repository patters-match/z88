Roadmap for 4.1 OZ release:

1) make source (disassebmly) complete ORG independent. Add GPL headers to sources.
2) You've implemented the new generic keyboard algorithm (actually a new feature)
3) Fixes of known OZ bugs (a good bunch of small stuff all around - see ref section in Dev Notes)
4) Internal reorganisation of code (realistically possible)
