TP = Thierry Peycru (pek@users.sf.net)
GBS = Gunther Strube (gbs@users.sf.net)


TODO (with priorities):
- Localize day/month lists. P1
- Choose day/month localization in the panel. P1
- Add Flash EPROM Format command in Filer. P1
- Add Select EPROM device command in Filer. P1
- Rewrite buffer interface to speedup serial routines. P1
- Modify NMI to allow use of RETN

- Transform OSSci to be page independant (OSSciTable). P2
- Transform OSCli to be page independant (Key2Meta routine). P2
- Remove hardcoded IN keys in SpecInternal and IsForeignKey (kbd.asm) P2
- Remove MU_*** in stdio.def they already exist with IN_*** P2

- Add ISO printer codes to PrinterEd from original localised V3.x ROMs. P3
- Test A=0 in OSSci. P3
- Fixes of known OZ bugs (a good bunch of small stuff all around - see ref section in Dev Notes). P3
- Preset default RAM device in Panel to expanded RAM card when identified by OZ. P3
- Validate flags in code after OS_Mpb -> OZ_MPB (fast bank switching) code replacements in OZ. P3
- Add a character table or implement a []+XXX interface to access all the ISO characters. P3
- Free RAM display in Index <>CARD display. P3.

DONE
- Rename nqsp.asm in spnq1.asm and move pagfi.asm into spnq1.asm P1
- Clean sysvar.def
- Move printer interface code in kernel. P2
- Clean misc2.asm, lots of space and speed to gain. P2
- Clean OSAlm. P2
- Move serial interface code in kernel. P3
- Move a maximum of code from K0 to K1 for the serial interface code. P1
- Fix CAPS behaviour. P1
- New OS_NQ, OS_SP parameters to handle localisation of keymaps and date/month names. P1
- New font bitmaps for ISO LATIN chars. P1
- PrinterEd menu 1/2 to correct. P2
- make source (disassembly) complete ORG independent. Add GPL headers to sources. P2
- Implement the new generic keyboard algorithm (TP)
- At the end of int.asm move HWclocks buffers in b20. (TP)
- Rewrite timeres.asm according HWClocks. (TP)
- Move OSMap to bank7. (TP)
- Change OzWindow for Deadkey codes. (TP)
- Remove Deadkeys.asm in b7. (TP)
- Clean misc6.asm, unfixed org, move 128K routines mixed into. (TP)
- Clean Lowram.asm, lots of space and speed to gain. (TP)
- Remove PAD94D5.asm. (TP)
- Put OSCli.asm tables in fixed area. (TP)
- Fast bank switching in lowram.asm using RST 30H and replace all OZ OS_Mpb calls in available sources. (GBS)
- Fast bank binding status in lowram.asm using CALL OZ_MGB and replace all OZ OS_Mgb calls in available sources. (GBS)
- Source code of font bitmaps and hidden token table for UK, FR, SE/FI & DK localisations. (GBS)
- EXTCALL - 24bit Call Subroutine in external bank, implemented using RST 10H vector using a total of 4 bytes per call. (GBS)
  (implementation allows absolute bank or slot-relative bank referencing)
- Removed auto-blowing of File Eprom Header during reset, when empty Eprom card found in slot 3. (GBS)
  (Actually, OS_EPR, A=EprSave is now the only function that tries to blow header on card. All other OS_EPR just reads
   the slot for a File Eprom)
- Moved MTH, Font, Keymap & 'OZ' ROM header out of bank 7 and relocated to new bank (GBS / TP)
- Token table now a separate entity - no longer embedded in bits 7,6 of LORES1 FONT bitmap (GBS / TP).
- 64 byte protected variable area during soft reset (TP).
- International Keyboard layout selection in Panel, and most ISO font bitmaps implemented (TP).
- Panel parameters Timeout, Repeat, Keyclick, Sound, Bad process size and Country parameters are preserved over soft reset (TP).
- Improved speed of serial interface I/O, (re-arranged code in kernel banks & increased low level buffers) (TP).
- Added Main help pages for all applications and popdowns (GBS).
- 'CLI' symbol in right hand side now flashes while CLI is active (TP).
- Implemented 1K File I/O buffer for file copy functionality in Filer, drastically speeding up file copying (16K in 2 secs!) (GBS).
- BBC BASIC integrated with Patch (Richard Russel).
- EazyLink is new standard popdown for easy remote file management (GBS).
- FlashStore integrated as standard Flash card management popdown. Uses new OS_Fep & OS_Epr interface instead of stdlib routines (GBS).
- After reset, try to execute global RAM "Boot.cli" (anywhere in any RAM), if /Boot.cli was not found in slot 3 File Eprom. (GBS)
- Move lowram image to MTH bank and modifiy reset routine. (GBS)
- New OS_Fep system call implemented to handle flash card hardware. (GBS)
- Current OS_Epr should be sub file-area aware in slot 3. (GBS)
- Implement new OS_Epr API with stdlib Epr* functionaility. (GBS)
- Rewrite/optimize current OS_Epr with new Epr* functionaility from stdlib. (GBS)
- Rewrite EPROM interface with Flash handling. (GBS)
- Faster GN_Sop/GN_Soe, implemented new OS_Bout/OS_Pout, and many OS_Pout optimisations in OZ & apps (GBS)
- Reorganized ROM application code to allow for new features in Index and Filer binaries. (GBS)
