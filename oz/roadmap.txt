Roadmap for 4.1 OZ release:

1) make source (disassebmly) complete ORG independent. Add GPL headers to sources.
2) You've implemented the new generic keyboard algorithm (actually a new feature)
3) Fixes of known OZ bugs (a good bunch of small stuff all around - see ref section in Dev Notes)
4) Internal reorganisation of code (realistically possible)

TODO (with priorities):
X At the end of int.asm move HWclocks buffers in b20. P1
- Rewrite timeres.asm according HWClocks. P1
- Move serial interface code in kernel. P3
- Move OSMap to bank7. P1
- Chang OzWindow for Deadkey codes. P1
- Remove Deadkeys.asm in b7. P1
X Clean misc6.asm, unfixed org, move 128K routines mixed into. P1
- Clean misc2.asm, lots of space and speed to gain. P2
- Clean Lowram.asm, lots of space and speed to gain. P1
- Remove PAD94D5.asm. P1
