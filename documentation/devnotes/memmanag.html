<b><font size="+1">6. Memory Management</font></b>
</p>
<p>Most operating systems provide calls to allocate chunks of memory and
free them after use. The Z88 is no exception; however, the largest chunk
of memory which can be allocated at any one time, and thus the largest
chunk which can be guaranteed continuous, is 256 bytes. The only way of
ensuring a larger continuous chunk is to set up the application as a so-called
'bad application'. This is wasteful of space and time as the OZ is forced
to reshuffle memory, hence the pejorative term attached. A well-written
application should only use the small chunks of memory, which for most
programs should not be difficult, and indeed should provide a useful discipline
as it tends to lead to little wasted memory in comparison with, say, reserving
a 100K chunk and probably leaving much of it unused.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Allocation</b>
</p>
<p>Reserved chunks of memory are allocated from larger 'pools'. To reserve
memory, the application must first allocate a memory pool, which is done
by the call <a href="osmop.html">OS_Mop</a>. This allocates a memory pool, set initially to 256
bytes in size, and a handle to refer to it. The only parameter for this
call is the memory mask. The value of the mask effects the segment to which
the logical address of allocated memory will refer. The allocation routine
will find a free page within a bank and place its 14 bit address in register
HL. The upper two bits are provided by the upper two bits of the memory
mask. The memory mask must be one of MM_S0 to MM_S3 which correspond to
segment 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
</p>
<p>Each memory pool is associated with a particular bank of RAM and so
all allocations from that pool are guaranteed to be in the same bank. This
is usefull to know as it can reduce the amount of bank switching that has
to be done. When a pool is exhausted a 'No room' error is returned - this
does not mean that the Z88 has run out of memory, but that there is no
more room in the bank associated with the pool to give to the application.
The application should now attempt to open another memory pool, which will
be associated with another bank, and allocate from there. If this attempt
is thwarted by a 'No room' error then the Z88 has no more memory it can
allocate to the application.
</p>
<p>Once a pool is openeded actual allocation can begin using the <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a>
system call. It is called with a pool handle, returned by the previous
<a href="osmop.html">OS_Mop</a> system call, and memory is allocated from the stock allocated to
the pool. If future calls of <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a> exhaust the 256 byte initially allocated
to the pool, the pool will expand to include more pages, one at a time.
A 'No room' indicates that the memory pool is exhausted, ie. it can find
no more free pages in its bank. If more memory is required, a new pool
will need to be opened, although it may be that there is no memory left.
</p>
<p><a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a> returns a bank number, the segment number implied by the pool's
memory mask and a logical address. The logical address consists of a 14
bit offset within a bank with the upper two bits defined by the memory
mask. Note that the allocated memory is not automatically paged in, so
before it can be used, the application must ensure that the relevant bank
is bound to the segment in which it is to be used. This will usually be
the same segment as specified in the memory mask, if not then the address
returned by <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a> will have to be altered (the upper two bits). The binding
calls are detailed below.
</p>
<p>The complement of <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a> is <a href="osmfr.html">OS_Mfr</a>, which will free a chunk of memory.
This may be a subset of a previously allocated chunk, although since a
partially allocated page cannot be used by other applications, it is only
really effective to free whole pages at a time. Finally, the complement
to <a href="osmop.html">OS_Mop</a> is <a href="osmcl.html">OS_Mcl</a>. This call will de-allocate all the memory associated
with the pool, meaning that each chunk does no have to be separately de-allocated,
and close the pool down. Pools must be closed off, even if all the memory
has been freed, otherwise the system will loose a handle and some memory.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Bindings</b>
</p>
<p>Now we have seen how memory is allocated we must show how allocated
memory can be paged into the logical address space. This involves binding
banks to specific segments. Two calls are provided for this purpose: the
first, <a href="osmgb.html">OS_Mgb</a>, return the current binding for a particular segment ie.
which bank is associated with the specific segment, but also returns the
old binding. The calls are not particularly slow, but if a lot of bank
switching is likely to occur then a faster mechanism can be used which
makes use of the Z88's 'fast code' facility detailed in "Miscellaneous
useful routines".
</p>
<p>The registers used for the memory management routines are carefully
chosen for programmer convenience. Once a pool is opened, register IX holds
the pool handle which <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a>, <a href="osmfr.html">OS_Mfr</a> and <a href="osmcl.html">OS_Mcl</a> require. The binding calls
expect a segment specifier (MS_S0 to MS_S3) in register C and a bank number
in register B, so <a href="osmal.html">OS_Mal</a> exits with these three registers appropriately
set. It establishes the segment number by reference to the memory mask
associated with the pool. <a href="osmpb.html">OS_Mpb</a> returns the old binding of the same segment
in register B, so providing BC is preserved the old binding, can be restored
simply by calling <a href="osmpb.html">OS_Mpb</a> again.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Example</b>
</p>
<p>This routine demonstrates how 256 bytes can be allocated and paged in
ready for use. Note the attention to errors, which is vital in the Z88
system because each application has to share with others.
