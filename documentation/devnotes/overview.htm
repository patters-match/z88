<b><font size=+1>1. Z88 Overview</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><i>Processor</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z80 running at 3.2768 Mhz.


<i>Circuitry</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most complex jobs are done by the BLINK gate array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chip.

<i>Memory</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Z88 can address up to 4M of memory. This is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; achieved by dividing the 64K address space of the Z80
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; processor into 4 16K segments. Each segment can then be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assigned to any of 256 16K banks, thus allowing a total
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of 4M. The first 64 banks are assigned to internal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; memory and the three card slots at the front of the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine are assigned 64 banks each.

<i>RAM</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32K internal, expandable by addition of external RAM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cards. 512K RAM may be soldered as internal RAM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replacing the 32K standard (requires also retracking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of circuitry).&nbsp; Current available are 128K, 512K and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1MB RAM cards.

<i>ROM</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 128K internal, expandable by addition of ROM cards. ROM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contains the operating system (OZ), built in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applications and hooks for external applications to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integrated into the system. The underlying hardware
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allows the internal ROM to be expanded to 512K.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, modification of the motherboard is needed to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add the extra address lines, since only 128K is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addressed.

<i>Screen</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 640x64 pixels, usually divided into 104x8 6 pixel wide
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters and 16x64 pixels of status information at
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the far right of the screen.

<i>Serial Port</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RS232 port, configured as DTE, for connecting a printer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or communicating with other devices. Tx, Rx, CTS, DCD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and RTS can be independently set and read, both
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; software and hardware handshaking are supported. The
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serial port runs at the following baud rates: 75, 300,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200, 38400.

<i>Power supply</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal batteries (4xAA, alkaline) or external 6.5V DC
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supply. Note NiCad's are not suitable, losing their
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge too quickly at the end of their life, thus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting data at risk. Also even if the Z88 is running
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off the power supply, batteries should be installed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This safeguards against power failure etc, which may
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause data to be lost in a machine with no batteries.

<i>EPROM's</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slot 3 contains circuitry for programming EPROM cards.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This circuitry unfortunately means that RAM cards in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot 3 consume much more power than in slots 1 and 2.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recommended that slot 3 is, therefore, not used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for RAM. Note also that when the machine is powered up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from cold (eg. for the first time) there is a small
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chance that an EPROM in slot 3 will be written to and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupted. Therefore, it is advisable to remove EPROMs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Z88 has had no power and you are about to apply
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32K, 128K and 256K EPROM Cards are available.

<i>Software</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OZ operating system. Index (application coordinator),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filer (RAM filing system), Panel (for system settings),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PrinterEd (for printer settings), Imp Export (for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communication with other machines), Terminal (VT 52
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compatible), Alarm, Clock, Calendar and Calculator.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also three fully blown applications: PipeDream
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (wordprocessor and spreadsheet), Diary and BASIC (a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version of BBC BASICZ80).

<i>Expansion</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three card slots at the front of the machine for RAM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or EPROM/ROM Cards. Expansion connector available for
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM applications, but is normally sealed.


</pre>
<b>Machine States</b>
<p>In order to save power the Z88 is able to close down sections of its
circuitry when they are not required for use. As areas of circuitry are
closed down the machine is thought of as falling asleep. There are four
states of drowsiness which successively use less power. Note that states
when the display is on (Awake and Snooze) are often referred to as 'on'
and the Coma state is often referred to as 'off'.
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><i>Awake</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z80 clock running and display on.

<i>Snooze</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z80 clock stopped and display on, ie. waiting for keyboard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity.

<i>Doze</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z80 clock running and display off, ie. programming EPROM.

<i>Coma</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z80 clock stopped and display off, ie. machine shut down.

</pre>
<b>Resetting</b>
<p>There are two forms of reset which can be performed on the Z88. A Hard
Reset completely clears the memory, thus any files stored in memory will
be lost, and resets all defaults and the real time clock. A Hard Reset
is performed by opening the flap, which covers the card slots at the front
of the machine, and then pressing the recessed reset button on the left
hand side of the unit, just below the power socket. A Soft Reset is performed
in the same way, but with the flap firmly closed. A Soft Reset will reset
many defaults and remove all applications and alarms. However RAM files
should be preserved, though this can never be absolutely guaranteed, and
the clock should not be affected. A Soft Reset can also be performed from
the Index by using the Purge command.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Applications</b>
<p>The Z88 applications are designed so that the user can switch between
one application and another, possibly different instantiations of the same
application. When an application is interrupted and other applications
are instantiated, it is said to have been pre-empted. When the pre-emption
is over the application is in the same state as it was before the interruption
and can continue as though nothing had happened. Sometimes the application
will have to tidy up the screen after a pre-emption, the system will tell
the application if this is necessary. Because more than one application
can be running at any one time (although only one runs, the others are
dormant - the Z88 is task switching not multi-tasking) the resources of
the machine must be carefully shared out. This means extra care must be
taken in writing applications and observing the rules, since a failure
in one application is likely to cause problems for the machine which will
effect other applications and stored files.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Menu and help system</b>
<p>The Z88 has a powerful system for entering commands through menu pages.
The menu pages can also support a keystroke sequence and a help page for
each command. To use this system the application writer simply has to set
up a static data structure of the appropriate form in the application ROM.
The system will then generate all the menu and help pages and return keyboard
codes when a menu or a keystroke sequence is entered. The system can be
seen working most fully in PipeDream; ROM space prevented the system having
more help pages, but these can be added on external cards.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Devices and files</b>
<p>The input/output scheme of the Z88 is based on named devices. File memory,
the screen, the keyboard, the printer and serial port are all treated as
devices. To use a device an application attempts to open a channel to the
device (with a file name for file devices, otherwise just the device name),
and if this is successful a handle is issued to reference that channel.
There are a limited number of handles in the system (about 150), and although
in practice they are unlikely to run out, the possibility must be taken
into account.
<p>The Z88 RAM filing system is divided into 5 devices. :RAM.0 accesses
internal memory and :RAM.1, :RAM.2, :RAM.3 access RAM in slots 1,2 and
3 respectively. The fifth RAM device is :RAM.- which can use memory from
anywhere in the system. Originally the intention was that this would be
used for scratch files which would be lost if a soft reset occurred. Unfortunately
a bug in version 2.2/3.0 of the operating system means that if there are
any files in :RAM.- when a soft reset (or purge) occurs the system will
almost inevitably crash, often requiring a Hard Reset. :RAM.- is best avoided
where possible and any files which do use it should be deleted immediately
after use. Some international V3.xx and V4 of the OZ operating system has
fixed this problem and files may be stored without crashing the machine
during
a soft reset.
<p>Before listing the available devices note that the EPROM archiving system
does not use a device type interface. Also note that it is not possible
to add extra devices to the system via application ROMs.
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><i>:RAM.n</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File device in slot n, 0=internal. Read and write.

<i>:INP.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard input device, usually the keyboard, but can be redirected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read only.

<i>:OUT.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard output device, usually the screen, but can be redirected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write only.

<i>:SCR.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screen. Write only.

<i>:COM.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serial port. Read and write.

<i>:PRT.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer. Data sent to this device is processed by the printer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filter whose settings are defined by the PrinterEd application.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write only.

<i>:NUL.0</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device does nothing, but can be useful when you want to send
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something nowhere, or get nothing from anywhere. Data sent is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrown away, reading returns an End of File message. Read and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write.

<i>:ROM.n</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated with application in slot n, 0=internal. This device can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be read using the DOR routines described later, but cannot be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a conventional device.


</pre>
<b>Streams and Filters</b>
<p>A stream is simply a communication channel associated with a handle.
Various system calls can take input or send output to a stream. For example
the system routine to convert binary to ASCII decimal numbers can direct
its output to the standard output stream rather than store the result in
a buffer in memory and then output the contents of that buffer as a string.
A filter is a general way of performing simple transformations on character
sequences. Text can be sent to a filter and then pulled out again, having
been processed according to the set of transformations associated with
the filter. Some system routines take a filter as their input, requiring
the application to have already sent text to the filter, and others as
output, requiring the filter to be read after the routine is complete.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Interrupts</b>
<p>The Z88 uses interrupts extensively in its general operation. Unfortunately
for external hardware it is not possible for the system to recognize and
deal with interrupts from outside sources - it is uncertain what the system
would do with an external interrupt. The following are the sources of maskable
interrupts, which are all mediated by the BLINK chip:
<br>&nbsp;
<pre><i>Keyboard</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key press causes an interrupt which can wake the machine from a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snooze.

<i>Flap</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, if the machine is on, will switch it into Doze, in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preparation for card insertion and removal. Note that the flap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should only be used when the machine is on, otherwise its movement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not properly recognized.

<i>UART</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serial processor in the BLINK chip generates interrupts to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordinate communications.

<i>Battery Low</i> This causes OZ to display a warning message in the status area (or
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OZ window) on the right hand edge of the screen.

<i>Clock</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clock interrupts periodically so that the Z88 can update the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time and date and check any pending alarms.</pre>
Non-maskable interrupts come from two sources, and again they are mediated
by BLINK:
<pre><i>Power fail</i>&nbsp; This puts the machine in a coma when power is very low.

<i>Timeout</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the machine has been inactive, but on, for the timeout period
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set in the panel, this interrupt occurs and puts the machine in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coma. Note certain activities reset the timeout value, such as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pressing a key, or reading the clock. This latter is why the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine will not timeout when the Clock is running.

</pre>
<b>Expanded and Non-Expanded Machines</b>
<p>Depending on the amount of memory in slot 1 the Z88 will either be expanded
or non-expanded. With 128K or more of RAM in slot 1 the Z88 is said to
be expanded. This has the effect of increasing the maximum width of the
graphics map to 256 pixels from 96, increasing the default bad application
size, used by BASIC, from 8K to 40K, and expanding the number of user definable
characters from 16 to 64. If extra memory is required, but not these expanded
parameters, extra RAM should be placed in slot 2 (or less preferably in
slot 3).
<p>V4 of the OZ operating system automatically recognises the machine as
expanded if the Z88 has been upgraded with 128K or more of internal RAM
(replacing the original 32K RAM). However this requires soldering.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The Screen</b>
<p>The screen is a supertwist liquid crystal display, driven by the BLINK
chip, and capable of displaying 640x64 pixels. This is usually arranged
as 104x8 6x8 pixel characters and 16x64 bits of status information on the
right of the screen (the OZ window). However an area of 10x8 characters
on the left hand edge of the screen is reserved by the system for the application
name and menu topic names. This gives applications a working area of 94x8
characters.
<p>The operating system provides a screen driver, which operates by sending
special codes to the screen, which provide a number of useful display facilities:
six windows (with optional borders and banners) for application usage;
up to 64 user defined characters; optional centering and left or right
aligning; tiny, bold, grey, inverted or flashing characters; horizontal
and vertical scrolling; controllable bleeps; the greying and ungreying
of windows; access to extra characters (such as box drawing, arrows and
keyboard icons). The driver provides access to all the display facilities
of the machine except high resolution graphics. High resolution graphics
are generally provided by the map interface, so called because PipeDream
uses it to make a map of the page being worked on. This is 64 pixels deep
and is from 8 to 256 pixels wide in 8 pixel steps. Note that the maximum
width is 96 pixels if the Z88 has less than 128K RAM in slot 1, ie. is
unexpanded. The interface allows only for a whole line of pixels to be
written at a time and there is no facility for reading back from the screen,
so if necessary the application needs to keep track of what has been written.
It is possible to access the screen more directly, although this is complicated
and may interfere with other applications, so where possible the map interface
is to be preferred.
<p>The Z88 Assembler Workbench provides library routines for plotting points,
drawing lines and sprites, and many other graphics utilities for in the
graphics area. The library routines are properly interfaced with the Z88
operating system, and can easily be integrated into applications.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Card Manager</b>
<p>The card slots at the front of the machine are the route by which memory
can be added and external software can be provided. EPROM cards, used for
archiving, are not part of the card manager scheme, since they do not effect
any part of the system outside of the Filer. RAM and ROM cards have effects
throughout the system and so the card manager exists to keep track of their
movements. The most basic rule of the card manager is the machine must
be on (ie. the display lit up) and the computer in the Index popdown. At
this stage RAM and ROM cards may be freely added. It is the removal of
cards, however, which is problematical.
<p>Removing a RAM card is a dangerous business. If a card is removed, a
flashing FAIL message will appear at the top of the OZ window and the Z88
will not respond to the keyboard. The machine should now be soft reset
(replacing the RAM card will not un-fail the machine because the data on
the card will have been lost), and with luck files in other RAM devices
will be intact. This cannot be guaranteed and it is recommended that files
are backed up on EPROM or on another computer. Fortunately removing a RAM
card need only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as upgrading
to a larger RAM. If a FAIL message occurs without removing a RAM card,
then some of the RAM memory in the machine may be faulty, however a software
crash can also cause a FAIL state to occur.
<p>ROM cards should only be removed from the Index, with the machine on.
Attempts to remove a card when not in the Index will result in a continuous
high pitched tone and a flashing INDEX symbol. The system will be locked
until the card is replaced in its original slot. After replacement go to
the Index before attempting to remove the card. If an application on the
ROM card is being used, indicated by the slot number next to the application
name in the suspended activities list, and the card is removed, the system,
once the flap is reclosed, will bleep and flash CARD in the OZ window.
The card must be replaced before anything else can be done. Removing cards
is very straightforward providing you make sure the machine is switched
on and close the flap after each removal and insertion, to check that no
rules have been disobeyed.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Alarms, timeouts and batteries</b>
<p>If an alarm occurs when the machine is in coma, the machine will be
woken up and held in lock out mode. This is indicated by a flashing LOCK-OUT
symbol in the OZ window. Lock out means that the keyboard is disabled and
normal working must be restored by switching the machine off and on again
using the two shift keys. The idea behind lock out is that an alarm may
awake the Z88 in a brief case, or some such, and lock out means that any
keys which may accidently be pressed will have no effect. The machine will
remain awake until the user intervenes or the machine times out. Lock out
mode can be forced by holding down CAPS LOCK before releasing the two shift
keys when switching the machine on.
<p>The timeout mechanism causes the machine to enter coma if it is on,
but inactive for the time set in the panel. The period is set in minutes
from 0 to 99 where a value of zero means never timeout. Keypresses and
reading the clock both reset the timeout count, meaning, for example, that
if the Z88 is in the Clock page it will never timeout. The timeout mechanism
can be used to save power, by ensuring an unattended machine switches off
after a short period. It may also be useful to have the machine permanently
awake, if waiting for input from the serial port, for example.
<p>When battery power is getting low a battery low interrupt occurs and
a BATT-LOW symbol is displayed in the OZ window. This is a warning that
batteries should be replaced in the near future. If batteries are not replaced,
and the system is in coma, the memory will be safe for days or even weeks.
If machine usage continues while the BATT-LOW symbol is present then eventually
it will begin to power fail. This is marked by violent screen flickering
and the machine going into coma. It becomes increasingly difficult to awake
the machine. At this point memory integrity may be in danger and fresh
batteries should be installed immediately, preferably a power supply should
be attached during this operation. If possible batteries should always
be replaced before a power fail can occur. Do not continue to try and work
with the machine after a power fail has taken place.
<p>Nickel Cadmium rechargeable batteries supply a steady current until
near the end of their charge, at which point the power they provide falls
very sharply over a short period of time. Alkaline batteries lose their
power slowly and so as their charge falls the battery low warning can be
given while there is still enough charge to keep memory safe. With NiCad
batteries there is no warning as to when they will lose their charge, the
first the user is likely to know about it is a dramatic power fail. The
consequence of this is that data loss is very likely when NiCads reach
the end of their charge, therefore they are not recommended for use with
the machine but may be used with great attention.
