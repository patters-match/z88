<p><b><font size=+1>18. The Serial Interface</font></b>
<p>The Z88 has a single serial port which has to be shared by all applications,
so it is important that applications use the system to access the port
to avoid interfering with the correct operation of other applications running
in the machine. The system runs the serial port using interrupts and buffering,
so most of its operation is transparent, but there are certain operations,
such as directly controlling the RTS line (required for auto-dialing by
some modems), which the system calls do not support and in these cases
the hardware is accessed more directly - see the "Hardware" section of
these notes. The serial port specification is reproduced here for convenience:
<pre>Baud rates  75, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200, 38400.
   Send and receive rates are independent.

Parity  None, Odd, Even, Mark, Space. Note the Z88 generates the
   appropriate parity, and will ignore, but not strip, the parity of
   incoming data.

Flow  Hardware handshaking with or without XON/XOFF.

Timeout  Output: 10 minutes is the default value
   Input: infinite is the default value

Buffer  Output: 95 bytes
   Input: 127 bytes</pre>
<b>Using the Serial Port</b>
<p>The serial port is accessed by opening the device :COM.0, using <a href="gnopf.html">GN_Opf</a>,
and then using the standard file I/O routines: <a href="osgb.html">OS_Gb</a>,
<a href="osgbt.html">OS_Gbt</a>,
<a href="ospb.html">OS_Pb</a>, <a href="ospbt.html">OS_Pbt</a> and <a href="osmv.html">OS_Mv</a>.
The device should be closed after the operation is complete. For most application
this level of access should be sufficient, however, it may be necessary
to change the serial port parameters from within an application. This is
done by writing new values to the Panel, using the
<a href="ossp.html">OS_Sp</a>
call, and then issuing a soft reset command to the serial driver. Changing
the Panel setting may affect other software in the machine, so should not
be undertaken lightly. It would be appropriate to reset the Panel to its
original setting after serial port operations are complete. This can be
achieved by first reading the Panel settings with <a href="osnq.html">OS_Nq</a>.
The "EazyLink" and "PCLINK II" popdowns use this technique.
<a href="ossp.html">OS_Sp</a> and <a href="osnq.html">OS_Nq</a>
are covered in detail in the "Miscellaneous useful routines" section.
<p>The serial soft reset operation is carried out by opening the <a href="ossi.html">OS_Si</a>
call. The <a href="ossi.html">OS_Si</a> call provides a low level access
to the serial port. The call can perform nine different operations depending
on the reason code passed to it:
<pre><i>Reason code</i>    <i>Action</i>
SI_HRD ($00)   Hard reset the serial port
SI_SFT ($03)   Soft reset the serial port
SI_INT ($06)   Interrupt entry point (System use only).
SI_GBT ($09)   Get byte from serial port
SI_PBT ($0C)   Put byte to serial port
SI_ENQ ($0F)   Status enquiry
SI_FTX ($12)   Flush Tx (transmit) buffer
SI_FRX ($15)   Flush Rx (receive) buffer
SI_TMO ($18)   Set timeout</pre>
This operating system call used for low level serial port communication
uses the following interface:
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>OS_Si, low level serial interface</font></b>
<p><tt>RST 20H, DEFB $8D</tt>
<p>IN:<pre>
   IX = handle returned from <a href="gnopf.html">GN_Opf</a> of ":COM.0"
   L = reason code
   Other register usage depends on L</pre>
OUT:<pre>
   Depends on reason code
   IX will always be unchanged

<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>
The serial various reason code parameters are descibed in detail in the
"System calls Reference" section.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Flow Control</b>
<p>Flow control can be controlled either be software or hardware. The hardware
handshaking is always active, so if you want to use software exclusively
you will need to wire a cable to set the handshaking lines high at all
times - ie. pins 5, 8 and 9 together on the Z88 D-connector.
<p>An external device can ask the Z88 to stop sending by either sending
an XOFF character or by de-asserting (bringing low) the CTS line. With
software flow control, transmission can only stop when the XOFF character
has been processed, so there is potentially a slight delay in response,
while previously sent characters are read. With hardware control, transmission
stops on the next character boundary. Transmission is resumed on the receipt
of an XON character, in the case of software control, or be re-asserting
CTS, ie. bringing it high. The output buffer is around 95 bytes long.
<p>If software control is used, the Z88 will send an XOFF to an external
device once the receive buffer is more than half full. Characters will
continue to be received until there are only 15 character spaces left in
the buffer. At this point an XOFF will be sent for every character subsequently
sent by the external device. If the receive buffer overflows then data
is lost forever. The Z88 will send an XON when the receive buffer has been
cleared to less than a quarter full. Under hardware control, the Z88 will
de-assert (bring low) RTS when the receive buffer is more than half full
and the re-assert (bring high) when it has become less than a quarter full.
The input buffer is around 127 bytes long.
<p>NOTE: When working with software handshaking the performance of the
serial port is seriously reduced. When working at speeds of 9600 baud or
above, the software handshaking will not work unless there is an intercharacter
gap, ie. some time is left between the sending of each character. The gap
allows the Z88 to catch up with serial operations, and without it the machine
may loose characters.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Serial Port Lines</b>
<p>The following table describes the 9-pin D-connector of the Z88:
<pre><i>Pin</i>   <i>Signal type</i>      <i>direction</i>
1 -   unswitched +5V at 10&#181;A  output
2 TxD  transmit data   output
3 RxD  receive data   input
4 RTS  ready to send   output
5 CTS  clear to send   input
6 -   not used
7 GND  Ground
8 DCD  data carrier detect  input
9 DTR  switched +5V at 10mA output</pre>
NOTE: DTR is high when the machine is awake. The machine is always awake
when the the screen is active, but even if asleep, the machine will wake
every minute or so to carry out various housekeeping tasks, such as checking
for alarms, and at these times DTR will go high. Pin 1 will show a signal
if there is power available to the machine.
