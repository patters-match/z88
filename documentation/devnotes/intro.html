<br>

&nbsp;
<p><b>Preamble</b>
</p>

<p>The aim of these notes is to provide a comprehensive description of
the hardware and software of the Z88 portable. The machine has a powerful
operating system which provides facilities for software to be added on
external cards, and integrated into the same environment which cares for
the built-in programs. External software can take full advantage of the
Z88's facility to switch between tasks, can use automatically generated
command menus with optional help pages, and is provided with a large number
of useful operating system calls, to access the screen, serial port, internal
filing system, printer driver, etc.
<br>

&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>Who these notes are for</b>
</p>

<p>These notes are primarily targeted at the software author interested
in writing applications for the Z88 using Z80 assembler, although it will also be useful to
anyone developing hardware. The emphasis is placed on authors whose programs
are destined for application cards, but a programmer using BASIC and needing
to exploit the facilities of the operating system will find what he or
she needs here.
</p>

<p>The notes assumes the reader is reasonably familiar with the Z88, and
that the User Guide supplied with it has been read and is available for
reference. Further, some basic knowledge of Z80 assembly language programming
has to be assumed, for while it would be perfectly possible to develop
software for the Z88 using a high level language compiler such as the <a href="http://www.z88dk.org/">z88dk</a> compiler. The information here,
therefore, is from the point of view of an application writer developing
in assembly language. Of course, this means that there is more than enough
information for customising a compiler if this is the preferred route.
</p>

<p>We would anticipate that most developers would use a Z80 assembler running
on a different machine, and would blow EPROM's from that machine to test
in the Z88. Alternatively EPROM's can be blown from the Z88 itself. There
is a simple development environment, which is the BASIC language which
comes with the machine and includes an in-line Z80 assembler. How to use
BASIC as a development environment is detailed in the "BBC BASIC and the
Assembler" section of these notes.
</p>

<p>Apart from development software you can download lots of nice applications from the "Z88 Forever" Web Homepage,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/z88forever/">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/z88forever/</a> (site is maintained by Garry Lancaster).
Here you can find everything about the Z88 portable computer that is worth knowing.
</p>

<p>The Z88 Development Project supplies a complete developers package that has
all the necessary facilities for programming applications on the Z88 (native), and
contains a modular Z80 assembler, debugger, EPROM programming software
and on-line help, all as resident applications on a 128K ROM. In addition,
a Z80 Cross Assembler that can be compiled on most C compilers on various operating systems to
compile Z80 Assembler source files on ordinary workstation computers, supplied
with a Z88 emulator that can run the compiled applications.
</p>

<p>All the assembler examples in these notes have been written in the format
used by the Z80 Cross Assembler <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mpm</span>, which is used as the standard tool for OZ development.
</p>

<p>The latest addition to Z88 software development is the project at
<a href="http://z88.linux.dk">http://z88.linux.dk</a>, which takes the Z88 to another level;
the development team are developing new tools (cross assembler &amp; Z88 emulator / debugger),
better system documentation and are working on a new, much improved OZ operating system.
The good part is that all source code is publicly available in a <a href="https://z88.linux.dk/svn/">Subversion repository</a>
(including OZ ROM), and under GPL license. You can browse the repository online clicking on
<a href="http://z88.linux.dk/fisheye/browse/Z88Svn/">this link</a> (using FishEye).
</p>
<p>Dominic Morris has over the years worked on a Z88 Development Kit which consists
of Small C+ pre-processor, compiler, optimizer, libraries, examples and more.
This package is regularly updated with new features, including the capability of
producing full-blown Z88 applications. This C development system now runs on
several Z80 based systems, including Sinclair Spectrum clones.

</p>

<p>An alternative high-level development environment is Z88 CamelForth
by Garry Lancaster. This also allows
for full application development. You can find the latest version at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/z88forever/camelforth/rom-camel.htmll">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/z88forever/camelforth/rom-camel.htmll</a>

<p><b>Structure of these notes</b>
</p>

<p>The notes begins with a general overview of the Z88. It is important
to study this carefully as many important concepts are dealt with, and
a good understanding of this section will make the rest of the notes much
easier to follow. Applications are talked about and guidelines for their
construction are given. Application construction is then covered in detail,
with the necessary static structure needed in the ROM card to let the system
know the size of the card, what applications it contains etc. In this section
the data structure for generating menus, command sequences and help pages
is also discussed. Before moving on to discussing the main body of system
calls, and how they are useful to the application writer, two important
subjects are tackled. Firstly the way in which errors are handled; some
errors include a request for an application to close itself down, and require
serious immediate action, whereas others might simply inform the application
that it may have been interrupted - perhaps the Z88 was switched off for
a while. Secondly the memory architecture of the Z88 and the system memory
management routines are explained.
</p>

<p>Understanding the memory organisation is the key to successful application
writing, so this section needs to be studied with care.
</p>

<p>Following from this material individual calls can be discussed in some
detail, starting with the most basic and commonly used and gravitating
towards the more esoteric. Before the extensive calls reference part of
the notes, Z88 hardware is discussed. The appendices include details of
internal application file formats (ie. PipeDream and Diary), hardware connections
and other general information. A glossary and index is provided.
<br>

&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>Important notice</b>
</p>

<p>lf you write an application which contains bugs or tries to circumnavigate
the operating system, then it is likely that all the other applications
in the Z88 will be affected. The effect may not be immediate, some indiscretions
take weeks or even months to become apparent, but will usually be in the
form of a system crash. You must always remember that the resources of
the Z88 are not devoted exclusively to your application and therefore only
use legal interfaces. Please note that all the internal applications follow
all the rules and use no 'back door' techniques.

<p><b>Release information, September 2007</b>
</p>

<p>This is the third major release of these notes and follow the latest OZ V4.2 release, identified with the same release number.
</p>

<p><b>Release information, October 1999</b>
</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the third release of the Developers Notes,
identified as V3.2 . Many things have been changed and added since version
2, especially the conversion from PipeDream format to HTML.
</p>

<p>The new V4 of the operating system was released long after the V2 notes.
Unfortunately, this documentation does not reflect the bug fixes of V4,
nor any improvements in V4. We hope to aquire information to be updated
in these notes as soon as it gets into our hands. All reported bugs in
the system calls reference refer to the V2.2/3.xx releases of the operating
system.

<p>Finally, many thanks to Vic Gerhardi, <a href="http://www.rakewell.com/">Rakewell
Ltd</a>, for his early support of these notes. Many details have come to
light because of those VERY old system printouts he had received from the
birth of the OZ operating system in the early days.
