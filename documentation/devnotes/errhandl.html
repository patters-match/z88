<p><b><font size="+1">5. Error handling and related issues</font></b>
</p>
<p>Before we can look at the details of constructing applications it is
necessary to look at the way in which the Z88 deals with errors. System
calls are accessed by using a Z80 RST instruction followed by one or two
bytes which determine the system function to be accessed. If an error occurs
the routine will return with the Carry of the flags register F (Fc) to
be set = 1 and a return code in register A. The return codes are symbolically
represented by "RC_xxxx", where "xxxx" is a mnemonic for the error. Most
errors may be handled in a straightforward way, with the Carry flag being
examined and appropriate action being taken depending on the value of register
A. However, a mechanism exists to trap errors before they return to the
part of code from which they were called. This mechanism is called an 'error
handler' and the programmer may install one or more of these for use with
the application. More than one error handler could be used if different
parts of the application had different error handling requirements. An
error handler will in general ignore most errors, returning to the code
from which the call originated with Fc = 1 and the error code intact in
A, however other errors may be trapped, dealt with and whatever return
code is thought fit can be returned to the running program. The error handler
should perform a RET instruction when it has finished it's work. Note that
this returns control to the operating system and not to the program which
made the original call.
</p>
<p>If an error occurs in a system call, then after the call has finished,
insofar as it is able, the error handler is called with Fc = 1, and a return
code in A, and possibly Fz = 1 to indicate a fatal error. Fatal errors,
such as RC_HAND, are so called because the system can take no reasonable
action to recover. On exit from the error handler a fatal error will generate
an interactive error box and following this RC_QUIT will be returned. For
non-fatal errors the error handler may take whatever action it wishes,
such as displaying an error message, but must always return control to
the error handler supervisor, with Fc = 0, by a RET instruction. This will
then pass control back to the program just after the call.
</p>
<p>NOTE: The error handler is programmer defined. The reference section
of these notes describes in detail which registers will be affected by
system calls on return to your application. When you install an error handler,
possibly other registers will be affected as well (which you use in the
error handler). If you wish the error handler to act neutral, then preserve
the Z80 registers before executing your error handler, and restore them
when the error handler has finished its work.
</p>
<p>Some errors occur because of some action by the user, such as pressing
the &lt;ESC&gt; key or switching between applications. The causes of these
kind of errors are:
</p>
<p>An Escape condition occurs.
</p>
<blockquote>The &lt;ESC&gt; key has been pressed while Escape detection is
enabled, eg. file transfer calls can be interrupted by &lt;ESC&gt;. This condition
gives rise to the RC_ESC code.</blockquote>

Possibility of pre-emption or suspension.
<blockquote>This can happen when the SQUARE or DIAMOND keys are used, menu
or help access has occurred, the machine has been switched off and back
on, or genuine pre-emption has occurred, ie. the user has switched tasks
and subsequently returned. This condition can give rise to RC_SUSP,RC_DRAW
or RC_QUIT.</blockquote>

RC_SUSP
<blockquote>Suspicion of pre-emption, the computer was switched off. This
code indicates that the screen is intact, but unsafe workspace may be changed.</blockquote>

RC_DRAW
<blockquote>Similar to RC_SUSP except that the application's screen has
been corrupted and the application should attempt to redraw it. Applications
which might find it very difficult to redraw a screen can ask the operating
system to preserve it for them before they are pre-empted. This can only
take place if there is enough memory to do so - some way of dealing with
RC_DRAW is still required. Note, it is also possible for applications to
save a particular screen image and restore it later - see <a href="ossr.html">OS_Sr</a>
in "Miscellaneous useful routines".</blockquote>

RC_QUIT
<blockquote>The process has been pre-empted and a KILL request made for
it from the INDEX (or by own suicide request). The reader may have noticed
from the screen that a KILL request causes the relevant process to be re-entered
momentarily - processes are always expected to kill themselves off in resonse
to this error; they are not killed BY the INDEX. RC_QUIT may also be returned
when after a fatal error has occurred.</blockquote>

RC_ESC
<blockquote>An Escape condition has been detected. This means &lt;ESC&gt;
has been pressed while Escape Detection is enabled. Note the Escape condition
must be acknowledged by <a href="osesc.html">OS_Esc</a>, otherwise the Escape
condition will continue to flag errors - acknowledging Escape is an ideal
job for an error handler.</blockquote>

<b>Pre-emptable Calls</b>
<p>Only calls which read the keyboard can be pre-empted. Since the keyboard
is usually bound to standard input the most common pre-emptable calls are:
</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="osin.html">OS_In</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get character from standard input<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="ostin.html">OS_Tin</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as <a href="osin.html">OS_In</a>, but with timeout<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="gnsip.html">GN_Sip</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get line from standard input<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="ossr.html">OS_Sr</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to generate a "Page Wait"</pre>

However, if file I/O is bound to the keyboard, then file read operations
will also be pre-emptable. Primarily the suspendable calls are all file
I/O and the delay routine (<a href="osdly.html">OS_Dly</a>), but again other
calls may be if they take their input from a stream which is opened to
the keyboard device. Remember some re-binding may be done by the user using
the CLI, covered later in "Standard I/O and the CLI".
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="osgb.html">OS_Gb</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get byte from file or stream<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="osgbt.html">OS_Gbt</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get byte from file or stream, with timeout<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="ospb.html">OS_Pb</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put byte to file or stream<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="ospbt.html">OS_Pbt</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put byte to file or stream, with timeout<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="osmv.html">OS_Mv</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move bytes between memory and file or stream<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="osdly.html">OS_Dly</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delay a certain period<br><br></pre>

<b>System error routines</b>
<p>The system provides four routines to handle errors:
</p>
<p><tt><a href="oserh.html">OS_Erh</a></tt>
</p>
<blockquote>Set error handler. This call installs a new error handler,
returnning the address of the old handler so that it may be re-installed
at a later date if required.</blockquote>

<tt><a href="osesc.html">OS_Esc</a></tt>
<blockquote>Examine special conditions. This call covers the details of
working with the Escape key, which can generate errors if required.</blockquote>

<tt><a href="gnesp.html">GN_Esp</a></tt>
<blockquote>Return a pointer to a system error message. A subset of error
codes have messages associated with them. This call returns an extended
pointer to an error message in the operating system ROM, if it exists.</blockquote>

<tt><a href="gnerr.html">GN_Err</a></tt>
<blockquote>Display system error box. This draws an error box on screen
which asks the user to press ESCAPE to continue, RC_DRAW or RC_SUSP will
be returned. In the case of fatal errors, eg. RC_BAD or RC_HAND, the user
is asked to press Q to quit and the routine exits with an RC_QUIT error.
The routine always exits with Fc = 1, ie. an error condition.</blockquote>

An error handling routine may be set up by using the system <a href="oserh.html">OS_Erh</a>
whose specification is:
<p>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<br>
<b><font size="+1">OS_Erh, set error handler</font></b>
<p><tt>RST 20H, DEFB $75</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>In:</tt>
</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = 0, other values reserved for system use<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B = 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HL = address of new error handler<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HL = 0, use default system error handler (in segment 0)<br><br>OUT:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fc = 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = old call level<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HL = address of old error handler</pre>

Registers changed after return:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...CDE../IXIY same<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AFB...HL/.... different</pre>
<hr width="100%">
<p>We can now consider the code the error handler should include. Fatal
errors may be ignored (include a RET Z at the start), because there is
no reasonable action to take anyway except termination of this instantiation
of the application. An RC_SUSP error code will generally be completely
ignored by the error handler whereas RC_ESC may want to be acknowledged
using <a href="osesc.html">OS_Esc</a>, or left pending for the main part
of the application to acknowledge. RC_DRAW could be responded to by calling
a routine to regenerate the screen and then quitting the error handler
with A = RC_SUSP and Fc = 0 as though nothing had ever happended. Other
errors may want to be reported, by outputting an error message.
</p>
<p>Finally, the error handler, rather than the main application, will generally
respond to a KILL request in the form of the RC_QUIT code. It must close
down it's application using <a href="osbye.html">OS_Bye</a>, but it is first
essential to close open resources like files, filters, streams and de-allocate
memory. If an application has not properly closed resources, in the form
of memory, handles and buffers, will be lost to the system. Files left
open will be permantently marked as "In Use" and so cannot be deleted or
opened for updating. To regain lost handles and resources to the system,
a soft reset must be issued.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Example</b>
</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the structure of an error handler
with a few responding error codes:

<hr width="100%">
<p>The error handler above responds to an Escape condition and a KILL request.
All other errors are 'ignored' with a display of the system message corrseponding
to the error code. Please note that no registers are changed, except Fc
(Carry) and Fz (Zero) flags. Your error handler might respond to RC_DRAW
and issue a routine to redraw the application windows. Remember that your
routines might change registers that they're not supposed to regarding
the outside world of the error handler.
</p>
<p>NOTE: When an error handler is installed, the system relies on having
it available in the corresponding segment (which the address of the error
handler identifies). If you change the bank binding state in the segment
of the error handler, thereby removing the original code, a call to that
address by the system would most likely crash the machine (executing random
instructions)!
</p>
<p>Further, we suspect a bug in OZ that crashes popdowns if the error handler
is resided in segment 2. Always keep error handlers in segment 3 - all
system applications do it.
