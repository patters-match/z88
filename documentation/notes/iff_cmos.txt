Notes from spectrum disk routines, the spectrum have a NMOS Z80 processor. All Z88 have a CMOS version without that IFF bug.

THE 'STORE INTERRUPT STATE' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine stores the Interrupt Flip Flop of the Z80 and returns with interrupts
disabled. Whenever the +D needs the interrupts to be disabled with disk operations the
status of the IFF (DI or EI) is stored. When the disk operation is finished the IFF is
restored to the state it was in before the interrupts were disabled.
NOTE: As a result of a bug in the Z80 itself the stored state of the IFF can be wrong if
interrupts are enabled. The problem occurs when an interrupt is accepted (implying: interrupts
enabled) during the execution of the 'LD A,R' or 'LD A,I' instruction. A solution to this
problem is a second test if the IFF indicates interrupts disabled. With a Spectrum it is
unlikely that two interrupts follow each other within a very short time, so a second test should
cure the problem. A better method can be found in the 'Zilog Z80 Family Data Book'. The best
method is replacing the Z80 with a CMOS version, the bug has been fixed in that Z80 type.

THE 'RESTORE INTERRUPT STATE' SUBROUTINE
This subroutine restores the interrupt state to the original state (DI or EI) (see NOTE
above).
