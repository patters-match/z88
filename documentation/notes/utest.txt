Here is from an email of 16 october 1999.

Have you noticed the fast baudrate option on bit 7 UTEST of the transmit
control register? I tried it for repeatedly transmitting the same
character and observing the output on an oscilloscope. I measured the
baudrate to about 214000 bps! I think regardless of Panel setting.
Because I don't have another Z88 (or possibly PC serial card supporting
230400 bps) for receiving I don't know how useful it might be. Probably
it is difficult to use the available speed effectively because one
character have to be processed in only about 150 T-states for full
speed.

Could perhaps be used for quickly copying RAM or ROM banks from one Z88 to
reserved RAM on another but I don't see any real use. Protocol would have to
be very simple like transmit 256 bytes while adding up an 8-bit checksum,
transmit checksum transmit next block etc. No ack for every block, just
accept correctly received data or quit receiving.

Gunther and I think that this was just to test serial port raw speed without any synchronisation like a burst mode. Let's see if it will be usable...
