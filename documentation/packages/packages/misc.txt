Miscellaneous "Packages" Calls
==============================


Find current process ID
-----------------------
The "Packages" package also provides the PKG_PID call, which returns the
ID of the currently running process. This could be useful to packages to
determine which application is currently calling them, if they need to
identify which resources belong to it, for example.

The call is very simple to use. It has no entry parameters, and exits with
A containing the process ID:

        call_pkg(pkg_pid)       ; A now contains current process ID


Example Code
------------
The Tester application uses the PKG_PID to name each instantiation of
itelf in the Index. Fully commented code can be seen in the sources.
