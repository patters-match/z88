PKG_INTR, Register interrupt handler

rst $08, defw $180f


IN:     A=reason code;
                int_prc, register single process interrupt routine
                int_pkg, register global package interrupt call
        C=type of interrupts to accept (set bits required);
                0: TICK (1/100s)
                1: SEC (1s)
                2: MIN (1m)
                3: UART
        B=# of acceptable interrupts required before running handler
        (eg set C=1, B=5 to run every 5 TICKs)
        HL=routine address (A=int_prc) or package call ID (A=int_pkg)
OUT(success):
        Fc=0
OUT(failure):
        Fc=1
        A=rc_room, no room to install handler
        A=rc_unk, unknown reason code

Registers changed after return:
  ......../IXIY same
  AFBCDEHL/.... different

Notes:
        If a handler for the same process or package is already installed,
        it will be replaced by the new handler specified.
        Single process interrupts are only serviced when the process is
        active *and* when no OZ or package call is in progress.
        UART interrupts are included for completeness only; no information
        is available on how to use them.
