Packages v1.12
==============

What's New in v1.12
-------------------
* PKG_NQ substitution added (internal use only)
* Bugfix for call substitutions: in v1.11, if a substitute call decided to
  let OZ do the hard work after all (or if the package had gone missing)
  the wrong register sets were selected and rather nasty crashes could occur.
  Therefore, calls must only be substituted with v1.12 of Packages and higher.

Original release notes
----------------------
The Packages package was initially intended to simply provide a mechanism
for installing other (more useful) packages. However, thanks to a weekend
spent drinking with the irrepressible Dominic Morris, it now has more
features than you can shake a stick at...

Facilities offered that will be useful to other packages and applications
are:

Bank Allocation         - Grab a whole 16K of memory in one go
Interrupts              - Run your code at varying frequencies
OZ Call Substitution    - Not for the faint-hearted!
Miscellaneous calls     - Find which process is running

Enjoy!
