		<h1>Section One - Getting started</h1>
		<p>Start here to find out how to get your Cambridge Z88 working for you.
		</p>
		<p>This section contains four introductory chapters:</p>
		<p><strong>Introducing the Cambridge Z88</strong> gives a foretaste of what the
			Cambridge Z88 can do.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Up and running</strong> explains how to insert batteries, switch on, and
			start writing your first document on the Cambridge Z88.</p>
		<p><strong>Applications and popdowns</strong> describes the programs provided in
			the Cambridge Z88, to help you decide which you want to learn about first.
			These are then explained more fully in the later sections.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Basic concepts</strong> explains a little more about the components of
			the Cambridge Z88: the keyboard, the display, and how the functions work.</p>
		<h1>Introducing the Cambridge Z88</h1>
		<p>The Cambridge Z88 is a unique computer for several reasons.
		</p>
		<p>For the first time in a machine of its size and portability it offers you a
			powerful productivity tool, PipeDream, capable of tackling the most demanding
			applications and providing all the capabilities normally only obtained by
			working with separate programs on much larger computers; it combines in one
			program most facilities provided by the best word processors, database
			programs, and spreadsheets.
		</p>
		<p>To complement PipeDream, the Cambridge Z88 comes complete with a range of
			utility programs, designed to anticipate any task you might wish to perform in
			the home or office; these include a clock, calculator, diary and organiser, and
			an alarm reminder.
		</p>
		<p>The Cambridge Z88 also avoids the problems of storing documents and applications
			long-term by providing battery-powered circuitry which will retain all the
			information in the computer for over a year while it is switched off. The
			batteries also maintain the correct time and date in an internal clock and
			calendar.
		</p>
		<p>In addition, communication with larger computers is catered for by built-in
			transfer programs.
		</p>
		<p>In no time, the Cambridge Z88 will revolutionise your life by making it possible
			for you to work with the tools you need, wherever and whenever you want.</p>
		<h2>Conventions in this manual</h2>
		<p>In this manual, anything displayed on the Cambridge Z88 screen is shown in a
			computer typeface, such as
		</p>
		<p><span class="screen">Name of file to save</span>
		</p>
		<p>Anything that you should type at the keyboard is shown in a different typeface
			to designate the keyboard keys; for example
		</p>
		<p><span class="type">You are invited to a party</span></p>
		<p>The keys on the keyboard with a special function are shown in the text with key
			legends. So, for example, if you are asked to type</p>
		<p><span class="type">myfile</span>
			<span class="key">ENTER</span></p>
		<p>you would actually type the letters
			<span class="type">m y f i l e</span>
			and then press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key.
		</p>
		<p>In general, references to menu headings are in bold caps; for example <strong>LAYOUT</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>References to individual commands are in bold; for example <strong>Save</strong>
			or <strong>Load</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>References to options displayed by a command are in italics; for example <em>Save
				only range of columns</em>.</p>
		<h1>Up and running</h1>
		<p>This section will explain how to get your Cambridge Z88 working for you as soon
			as possible. Once you have tried out the simple examples in the next few pages
			you should have a feel for what the Cambridge Z88 can do for you, before
			proceeding to the later sections at your leisure.</p>
		<h2>Fitting batteries</h2>
		To run the Cambridge Z88 you will need the following batteries:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Four alkaline cells, Size AA, type MN1500 or LR6.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other types of the same size can be used in an emergency, but we recommend the
			use of the leak-resistant alkaline type as these will keep your Cambridge Z88
			working for longer without needing replacement.
		</p>
		<p>With these batteries an unexpanded Cambridge Z88 will give about 20 hours of
			active computing, and the data will be preserved in the machine while it is
			switched off for up to a year.
		</p>
		<p>For heavy indoor use the mains power unit is recommended.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Note that the procedure described here is not the same as the one for
				replacing existing batteries. In this case refer to Appendix A.</strong></p>
		<h2>Inserting the batteries</h2>
		<IMG src="images/007_1.png">
		<p>The four batteries are housed in a row in the battery compartment, under a flap
			on the rear of the Cambridge Z88 case.</p>
		<p>To insert batteries for the first time, use the following procedure:</p>
		<p>1. Remove the cover from the battery compartment on the back of the Cambridge
			Z88 case, and insert one battery at each end of the compartment.
		</p>
		<p>Make sure the batteries are fitted the correct way round, as indicated by the
			diagram in the battery compartment.</p>
		<p>2. Insert the remaining two batteries to make an 'A' shape above the case. Make
			sure that all four batteries are facing in the same direction, with the correct
			polarity.
		</p>
		<p>Then push down on the two batteries so that they click into place.</p>
		<p>3. Replace the battery compartment cover firmly.</p>
		<IMG src="images/007_2.png">
		<h2>Initialise the Cambridge Z88</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Open the transparent cover to the card slots.
			<li>
				Locate the reset button, which is situated behind a hole on the left-hand edge
				of the Cambridge Z88 case.<br>
				<IMG src="images/008_1.png">
			<li>
				Press the reset button twice, using an unbent paperclip to reach into the hole.<br>
				<IMG src="images/008_2.png">
			<li>
				Close the card slot cover. This gives a hard reset, initialising the Cambridge
				Z88 to make it ready for use.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Adjust the display</h2>
		<p><IMG src="images/008_3.png">&nbsp;</p>
		<p>1. Turn the contrast control as far towards the top of the Cambridge Z88 case as
			it will go (ie clockwise).</p>
		<p>2. The screen should display a dark blue rectangle.</p>
		<p>3. Gradually turn back the control until you can see the Cambridge Z88 screen
			clearly.</p>
		<h2>Set the clock</h2>
		<p>When you first install batteries you will need to use the Clock popdown to set
			the correct date and time using the following procedure:</p>
		<OL>
			<li>
				Press <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">
			T to enter the clock popdown.
			<li>
				Press <IMG alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle">
				to highlight the <em>Set</em> option:<br>
				<IMG src="images/009_1.png">
			<li>
				Press
				<span class="key">ENTER</span>
				to enter the Set function, which displays the previous (incorrect) date and
				time, and will allow you to alter these to their correct values:<br>
				<IMG src="images/009_2.png"><br>
				You can move the cursor between the time and date with <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png">
				and <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png">.<BR>
				You can also move the cursor left and right along the digits with the <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">
				and <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png">
			keys. Moving off the end of the date will position the cursor on the time, and
			vice versa.
			<li>
				Having positioned the cursor, simply type the correct time or date, using the
				numeric keys 0 to 9. The format of the new time and date should not change; if
				you type over the '/' or ':' signs, move the cursor back with the <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">
				key and replace them.<br>
				<br>
				When you have set the correct values, press
				<span class="key">ENTER</span>
				to confirm them, and after about two seconds the correct time and date will be
				displayed.<br>
				<br>
				Finally, press
				<span class="key">ESC</span>
				to exit from the Clock.
			</li>
		</OL>
		<h2>Try typing text</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Hold down the <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">
				key (at the bottom left of the keyboard) and press the P key, to enter
				PipeDream.<br>
				<IMG src="images/010_1.png">
			<li>
				Type
				<span class="type">Dear Sir,</span>
				at the keyboard. Press the
				<span class="key">DEL</span>
				key to delete mistakes. If you type more than will fit on one line, PipeDream
				will automatically lay out the text for you.<br>
				<IMG src="images/010_2.png">
			<li>
				Return to the Index by pressing the
				<span class="key">INDEX</span>
				key. Your letter will be kept as a suspended activity; go back to it by
				pressing <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">
				P again. You are now ready to proceed with the examples of using the Cambridge
				Z88 in the following sections.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Switch off</h2>
		<p><strong>There is usually no need to worry about switching your Cambridge Z88 off. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>If you do not type anything for several minutes the machine will automatically
			switch off to conserve power.</p>
		<p>You should always switch your Cambridge Z88 off before, for example, carrying it
			in a briefcase. This is because the keys may get pressed, disturbing • what you
			were in the middle of doing, or keeping the Cambridge Z88 on and wasting the
			batteries.
		</p>
		<p>To switch off press both
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			keys simultaneously.</p>
		<p>To switch the Cambridge Z88 on again at any time, press both
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			keys simultaneously.</p>
		<h1>Applications and popdowns</h1>
		<p>The Cambridge Z88 comes with two types of built-in program, called <strong>applications</strong>
			and <strong>popdowns</strong>. For most of your work, you will probably use the <strong>
				applications</strong>, for writing text, setting up financial calculations,
			or organising information and appointments.
		</p>
		<p>The <strong>popdowns</strong> perform simpler tasks, and are equivalent to
			desktop tools. They can be called up from within any application whenever you
			need them, and in the cases of the alarm clock, calculator and calendar, will
			generally be most useful for making a rapid check or record of information. So,
			in the middle of typing a letter, for example, you could use the Calculator to
			perform a quick calculation, and then return immediately to the letter by
			pressing
			<span class="key">ESC</span>.
		</p>
		<p>You can keep several unfinished documents in your Cambridge Z88 at once: when
			you return to one of them to continue working on it, everything will be exactly
			as you left it. The Cambridge Z88 is designed to leave you free to do things in
			whatever order you wish, and whenever you want. It does the work, and leaves
			you free to get on with the thinking.
		</p>
		<p>The next few pages will give an overview of what the Cambridge Z88 applications
			and popdowns can do. The TUTORIAL, in Sections Two, Three, and Four, then gives
			fuller descriptions of each application and popdown, with examples of their
			use.</p>
		<h2>The applications</h2>
		<p>The following applications are provided in the Cambridge Z88:
		</p>
		<H3>Creating documents - PipeDream</H3>
		<p>A typewriter may enable you to type in text, correct mistakes as you type them,
			and underline text, but as soon as you need to make revisions, you inevitably
			have to retype parts of what you have already written.
		</p>
		<p>In <strong>PipeDream</strong> you can carry out proof corrections, sorting
			operations, and complex calculations with a few keystrokes, without you having
			to retype any of the text.</p>
		<p>Some facilities, such as the ability to move blocks of text around, will be
			familiar to anyone who has already used another word processor. Other features,
			like the ability to put a list of items into numerical order or the ability to
			perform calculations on tables of values, are normally only found on specialist
			pieces of software specifically designed for these tasks.
		</p>
		<h3>Organising your time - Diary
		</h3>
		<p>The Diary program provides a quick way of organising events, and keeping
			day-to-day information, such as expenses. Like a desktop diary, there is a page
			for each day, on which you can write engagements and other information. But the
			Cambridge Z88 diary also caters for the likelihood that you might want to find
			something you wrote down on a previous occasion; if you cannot remember even
			the month of a particular exhibition, just search for 'exhibition' and the
			Diary will find the page for you. You can also print out entries of a certain
			type, which makes it easy to produce expense claims, or worksheets.</p>
		<h3>Writing a program - BBC BASIC
		</h3>
		<p>The Cambridge Z88 comes complete with the <STRONG>BBC BASIC</STRONG> programming
			language which will allow you to program the computer to carry out sequences of
			instructions. For example, if you wanted to process some complicated
			statistical data, or convert the format of a file, the simplest way to do this
			might be to write a program using BBC BASIC.
		</p>
		<p>BBC BASIC is also an ideal language for learning to program, and many books on
			programming are available for use with it.
		</p>
		<h3>Talking to another computer - Terminal
		</h3>
		<p>The Terminal application allows you to set up a conversation with another
			computer, using the VT52 standard. With a modem, this will allow you to access
			information databases via a telephone line.
		</p>
		<h3>Create a printer driver - PrinterEd
		</h3>
		<p>The applications will print on any serial printer connected to the Cambridge
			Z88, but to make full use of a particular printer's capabilities, such as
			special fonts and highlighting features, you may want to create your own driver
			selecting whichever features you require. The PrinterEd application makes this
			a simple task.</p>
		<h2>The popdowns
		</h2>
		<p>Popdowns are programs you can call from within an application, to perform a
			service without breaking off from what you are doing.
		</p>
		<h3>Managing resources - Index
		</h3>
		<p>The Index popdown is the key to all other Cambridge Z88 applications and
			popdowns. From here you can call any other application or popdown, or resume an
			activity you suspended on a previous occasion. The Index also contains the Card
			Manager, which shows what memory cards or plug-in applications are present in
			the Cambridge Z88, and allows you to insert or remove cards.
		</p>
		<h3>Performing rapid calculations - Calculator
		</h3>
		<p>You can use the Calculator to make quick calculations -even if you are in the
			middle of doing something else at the time. Its features include ten memories,
			and aunits-conversion facility. So, for example, you can convert from litres to
			gallons with a few key-presses.
		</p>
		<h3>Looking up dates - Calendar
		</h3>
		<p>The Calendar means that you can plan your appointments for the coming weeks at a
			glance; and when you need to make a Diary entry, you can use the Calendar with
			the Diary to find the day you want immediately (see pp. 69-70 for details).</p>
		<h3>Knowing the time - Clock
		</h3>
		<p>The Clock will show you the time and date instantly, without your having to look
			away from whatever else you are doing.
		</p>
		<p>All files and suspended activities are labelled with the time and date, so be
			sure that you have set the clock before you use the Cambridge Z88.
		</p>
		<h3>Remembering appointments - Alarm
		</h3>
		<p>The Alarm application allows you to set up a number of alarm reminders, with a
			given time and, if required, date. Each reminder can include a message, and
			reminders can be programmed to alert you at the same time every day, month, or
			other interval. You can even set the alarm to run a program.</p>
		<h3>Working with files - Filer
		</h3>
		<p>The Filer gives you access to the Cambridge Z88 filing system, where you can
			store documents and BBC BASIC programs in the Cambridge Z88 RAM, or for more
			permanent storage on an EPROM card. Although the filing system supports a
			flexible hierarchical directory structure, for simple applications directories
			can be ignored.
		</p>
		<h3>Customise the Cambridge Z88 - Panel
		</h3>
		<p>The Panel is a set of controls for the Cambridge Z88, allowing you to tailor the
			way that the keyboard, filing system, sound, and serial interface work to your
			own preferences.
		</p>
		<h3>Transferring files to another computer - Import/Export
		</h3>
		<p>The Import/Export popdown enables you to transfer documents to or from another
			computer, using a simple set of commands.</p>
		<H1>Basic concepts</H1>
		<P>Before trying an application on the Cambridge Z88, you need to be familiar with
			the basic concepts which are common to all applications. These involve
			selecting what you want to do, be it running an application or performing an
			operation within an application, and then carrying it out with the appropriate
			command from the keyboard.</P>
		<H2>The keyboard</H2>
		<P>The Cambridge Z88 keyboard looks like a normal typewriter keyboard with the
			familiar gwerty arrangement of letters.
		</P>
		<P>
			<IMG src="images/015_1.png">
		</P>
		There are some additional keys on each side of the keyboard which have the
		special functions explained below.
		<P></P>
		<H3>The letter and number keys</H3>
		<P>Press the letter keys alone to give the lower-case letters, or with
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			to get capitals. You can get capitals without needing to hold down
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			by pressing
			<span class="key">CAPSLOCK</span>
			- see below.</P>
		<P>Press the digit keys on the top row of the keyboard to give the digits, or
			with&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			to give the symbol above each digit on the key.</P>
		<P>Vote that, unlike on some typewriters, the letter O is quite different in
			meaning Yom the digit 0, and the letter l(lower-case L) from the digit 1.</P>
		<H3>On the left-hand side of the keyboard:
		</H3>
		<P><span class="key">ESC</span><BR>
			will normally cancel what you are currently doing, and go back to the most
			appropriate point just before.
		</P>
		<P><span class="key">TAB</span><BR>
			is like the tabulate key on a typewriter. Use it for making columns of figures,
			or arranging tables.
		</P>
		<P><span class="key">MENU</span><BR>
			enables you to select which of the Cambridge Z88's operations you want to carry
			out. These are explained in greater detail in the section Using menus on p. 20.</P>
		<P><span class="key">INDEX</span><BR>
			will return you to the Index from within an application.
		</P>
		<P><span class="key">HELP</span><BR>
			gives you a display of information about the action you are currently carrying
			out. Further information is then available on related topics.
		</P>
		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"><BR>

			move the cursor up, down, left or right on the screen.
		</P>
		<H3>Caps lock modes</H3>
		<P>Two caps lock modes are available which determine the way that the
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			key operates. The mode selected is indicated by a symbol at the bottom
			right-hand corner of the screen. The state of the caps lock mode is stored with
			each application, so you can, for example, keep one mode set up for PipeDream
			and another for BASIC. The operation of each mode is as follows:</P>
		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><span class="key">CAPSLOCK</span><BR>
			selects Normal Caps mode. The letter keys give capitals, irrespective of the
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			key. Displays:

		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"><span class="key">CAPSLOCK</span><BR>
			selects Inverted Caps mode, giving capital letters normally, and lower-case
			with the&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span>
			key. Displays:
		</P>
		<P><span class="screen">caps</span></P>
		<P><span class="key">CAPSLOCK</span><BR>
			switches on and off the selected mode.</P>
		<H3>Special characters</H3>
		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			' gives&nbsp;'´' (grave accent), and <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			SPACE gives an exact space, displayed as '...'.</P>
		<H3>Cleaning the keyboard</H3>
		<P>The keyboard should be kept free from dust by cleaning it periodically with a
			damp lint-free cloth, or sponge. Solvents should not be used.</P>
		<H2>The Index
		</H2>
		<P>The Index popdown allows you to call up Cambridge Z88 applications or popdowns,
			or to return to any activity that you were previously working on.
		</P>
		<P>To see the Index screen at any time, press the&nbsp;<span class="key">INDEX</span>
			key at the lower left of the keyboard. To return to an application from the
			Index, press
			<span class="key">ESC</span>.</P>
		<P>The components of the Index screen are identified below:<IMG alt="" src="images/018_1.png"></P>
		<P>The right-hand edge of the screen is reserved for status information from the
			Cambridge Z88 operating system. It displays OZ when the Cambridge Z88 is ready
			for use.</P>
		<H2>Entering an application
		</H2>
		<P>To enter an application, or a popdown, you simply have to select its name on the
			APPLICATIONS menu by moving the highlighting bar up and down with the cursor

			key to enter it.</P>
		<H3>Creating a new activity</H3>
		<P>Entering PipeDream or BBC BASIC from the Index APPLICATIONS list creates a new,
			blank document.
		</P>
		<P>For example, to enter PipeDream, starting with a new blank document, move the
			highlighting bar until
			<span class="screen">PipeDream</span>
			is selected, and press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key; you will then see the PipeDream screen:
		</P>
		<IMG alt="" src="images/019_1.png">
		<H2>Suspended activities
		</H2>
		<P>If you return to the Index after creating a document in PipeDream (or writing a
			program in BBC BASIC), your activity will be suspended, and you will see it
			listed in the list of SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES. This shows the time and date you
			were last working on the document under the heading
			<span class="screen">WHEN SUSPENDED</span>, and if a name has been given to the
			document (with the PipeDream <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FC

			commands, or the BASIC *NAME command), the name will be shown in the column
			headed
			<span class="screen">YOUR REF</span>. You can keep as many PipeDream and BBC
			BASIC suspended activities as you want, subject to the available memory.</P>
		<H3>Re-entering a suspended activity
		</H3>
		<P>You can re-enter a suspended activity by selecting it on the list of SUSPENDED
			ACTIVITIES. Move the highlighting bar across with the&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png">
			key if necessary, and then press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key. Alternatively, pressing<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">P

		<H3>Killing activities - <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">KILL
		</H3>
		<P>Each suspended activity does, of course, use up some memory space; some for the
			document you are working on, plus a small overhead needed by the application.
			You can therefore kill activities you no longer need to work on in order to
			free the memory space. Save the document (or program) first if you may need it
			again.
		</P>
		<P>To kill a suspended activity, select it on the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES list with
			the cursor, and type <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">KILL.
			The activity will be removed from the list, and any document (or program)
			associated with it will be lost.</P>
		<H2>Using menus</H2>
		<P>The Cambridge Z88 applications, and some popdowns, use menus to show you what
			operations are available at any stage, and to give you a simple way of choosing
			the one you want from among them. In keeping with the philosophy of the
			Cambridge Z88, menus free you from having to remember cryptic sequences of
			commands to be typed from the keyboard, and allow you to do what you want as
			quickly as possible.
		</P>
		<P>The items on each menu all relate to one particular type of operation. For
			example, all the operations to do with printing are listed on a <STRONG>PRINT</STRONG>
			menu. The menu headings are shown on the Menu List, which is displayed on the
			left-hand side of the screen under the name of the application or popdown.
		</P>
		<P>To use menus you have to:</P>
		<P>1 Select the menu you want from the menu list.</P>
		<P>2 Select the operation you want to perform from that menu.</P>
		<P>3 Execute the operation.
		</P>
		<P>These three steps are now explained in greater detail.
		</P>
		<H3>Selecting a menu</H3>
		<P>As an example of using menus, try using the menus in the PipeDream application.
			First enter PipeDream from the Index as already described.
		</P>
		<P>The menus available in any application are listed at the left-hand side of the
			screen, under the application name.
		</P>
		<P>For example, the menus in PipeDream are given under the heading
			<span class="screen">PIPEDREAM</span>. Each title refers to one type of
			operation you can perform with PipeDream. For example, the first menu, the <STRONG>BLOCKS</STRONG>
			menu, contains operations you can perform on a block of text.
		</P>
		<P>Pressing the&nbsp;<span class="key">MENU</span>
			key will display this menu, and
			<span class="screen">BLOCKS</span>
			will be highlighted in bold letters on the Menu List. To look at a menu further
			down the list, press the
			<span class="key">MENU</span>
			key until you reach it. If you go past the menu you want, keep pressing
			the&nbsp;<span class="key">MENU</span>
			key until it circles back around to the top of the list.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/020_1.png"></P>
		<P>For example, to select the <STRONG>FILES</STRONG> menu, you need to press the
			<span class="key">MENU</span>
			key three more times. You can always check which menu is displayed by the title
			in bold on the Menu List.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/021_1.png"></P>
		<H3>Selecting an operation</H3>
		<P>You select a menu item by moving the highlighting bar with the cursor keys <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png"><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png"><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png">
			until the operation you want is highlighted.
		</P>
		<H3>Executing the operation
		</H3>
		<P>To perform the highlighted operation, simply press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key.
		</P>
		<P>For example, on the <STRONG>BLOCKS</STRONG> menu example shown above, press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key to perform the <STRONG>Mark Block</STRONG> operation.
		</P>
		<H3>Options</H3>
		<P>Many operations give you a list of options before actually carrying out the
			command. The <STRONG>Save</STRONG> command, on the <STRONG>FILES</STRONG> menu,
			is an example; press&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png">
			to highlight the <STRONG>Save</STRONG> command. When you press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key you will see the following prompts:
		</P>
		<P><span class="screen">Name of file to save
			<BR>
			Save only range of columns No
			<BR>
			Save selection of rows No
			<BR>
			Save marked block No<BR>
			Save plain text No</span>
		</P>
		<P>In this case you can simply type in a file name, such as
		</P>
		<P><span class="screen">Name of file to save Myfile</span>
		</P>
		<P>and press the
			<span class="key">ENTER</span>
			key to carry out the <STRONG>Save</STRONG>.</P>
		<P>The other options under the <STRONG>Save</STRONG> command have only two
			possibilities each,
			<span class="screen">Yes</span>
			and
			<span class="screen">No</span>. You can alternate between them in two different
			ways:
		</P>
		<P>1 Type
			<span class="type">Y</span>
			for
			<span class="screen">Yes</span>
			and
			<span class="type">N</span>
			for
			<span class="screen">No</span>
			as appropriate.
		</P>
		<P>2 Use the <STRONG>Next Option</STRONG> or <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">J
			command to display the alternative value. (With options which have specific
			values, <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">J
			will restore the default; see <STRONG>Setting the options</STRONG>, p. 101, for
			more details.)
		</P>
		<H3>Escaping from an operation
		</H3>
		<P>If you decide against performing an operation from the menu, press the
			<span class="key">ESC</span>
			key and the menu will disappear from the screen.
		</P>
		<P>It may take you a little while to become familiar with using the menu operations
			to carry out your wishes, but once you have mastered menus you will be able to
			use all of the applications on the Cambridge Z88 without difficulty.
		</P>
		<H2>Short cuts - <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"></H2>
		<P>
			Menus make it easy to locate what you want to do even if you are not familiar
			with an application. But with a little experience you will find you know
			exactly which operation you want to carry out, and so will appreciate the short
			cuts which allow you to carry out any action without going through a menu.</P>
		<P>Each operation can be called up by typing the special <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			key (called 'diamond'), followed by a sequence of one or more letters. When you
			type a&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			sequence, the operation will be carried out instantly, no matter what you were
			doing in the application. If you do not keep the&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			key held down while you are entering a&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			sequence, the letters are shown at the right-hand side of the screen as a
			reminder.
		</P>
		<P>The short cuts are shown on each menu so that you can refer to them if
			necessary. For example, the short cut for the <STRONG>Save</STRONG> operation,
			shown on the <STRONG>FILES</STRONG> menu above, is <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FS.
			Also, the most useful of these operations are shown on the list of key
			functions above the Cambridge Z88 keyboard.
		</P>
		<P>Note: Normally <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
			and&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">
			may be used either by holding them down whilst typing the sequence, or by
			pressing and releasing them and then typing the sequence. There are two
			exceptions to this; these are <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">ESC
			and <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">ESC
			where they must be held down.</P>
		<H3>Line editing</H3>
		<P>In most situations where you are entering a line of text in the Cambridge Z88,
			such as in response to a prompt, the following commands are available to make
			corrections and alterations to what you are typing:</P>
		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">,<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png">
			moves the cursor left and right</P>
		<P>
			<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">,<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png">
			moves the cursor to the beginning or end of a line&nbsp;</P>
		<P>
			<span class="key">DEL</span>
			deletes the previous character&nbsp;</P>
		<P>
			<span class="key">SHIFT</span>&nbsp;<SPAN class="key">DEL</SPAN>
			deletes the character at the cursor position
		</P>
		<P>
			<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">D
			deletes to the end of the line
		</P>
		<P>
			<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">T
			deletes a word
		</P>
		<H2>Memory low condition</H2>
		<P>When you have almost filled the Cambridge Z88 memory, with applications or data,
			the menu-selection of commands is automatically disabled to conserve memory.
			The highlight bar disappears, and the prompt display, at the right-hand side of
			all menu screens, changes to indicate that menu commands can no longer be
			selected with the cursor keys:</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/023_1.png"></P>
		<P>In the memory-low condition the command short cuts must be used until enough
			memory has been freed from the machine.
		</P>
		<H2>Soft and hard reset</H2>
		<H3>Soft reset</H3>
		<P>In the unlikely situation of the Cambridge Z88 not responding to any keyboard
			Input it can be given a soft reset. This will remove all the suspended
			applications in the Cambridge Z88, and clear any temporary work space being
			used by the operating system, but should retain all files.</P>
		<P>To give a soft reset, press the reset button twice. The display will briefly
			show</P>
		<P><span class="screen">SOFT RESET ...</span></P>
		<P>and then return to the Index. The operating system does its best to retain all
			files in the internal or external memory, and usually succeeds.
		</P>
		<H3>Hard reset</H3>
		<P>Hard reset completely initialises the Cambridge Z88, clearing all memory, losing
			all files, and resetting the clock. Hard reset is described in <STRONG>Initialise
				the Cambridge Z88</STRONG>, p. 8. After a hard reset the Cambridge Z88 will
			display</P>
		<P><span class="screen">HARD RESET ...</span>
		</P>
		<H2>Help</H2>
		<P>The Cambridge Z88 contains a Help system with highly-structured information on
			many operations and facilities provided by the machine. The problem new users
			of a computer often face is that they need to find out how to do something but
			are not quite sure where to look. The Cambridge Z88 Help system overcomes this
			problem by allowing you to 'browse', from Help information on one topic to
			information on related ones which might also provide_ the information you
			require. The help information is limited on the basic machine, but there is the
			provision of extending it with a Help application card.
		</P>
		<H3>Getting help</H3>
		<P>To find out information about a particular topic all you have to do is press
			the&nbsp;<span class="key">HELP</span>
			key at the bottom left-hand side of the keyboard. The Help system will then
			automatically give you information on the menu or operation within the
			application you are currently using.
		</P>
		<H3>Browsing within Help</H3>
		<P>The cursor keys&nbsp;<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">
			<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"> <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png">
			<IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"> and
			the
			<span class="key">HELP</span>
			key allow you to obtain more information, as shown on the Help screen.
		</P>
		<H3>Returning to your application</H3>
		<P>To exit from the Help system and return to your application, press the&nbsp;<span class="key">ESC</span>
			key.</P>
		<H1>Using cards</H1>
		<P>There are three types of card for use with the Cambridge Z88:
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>RAM</STRONG> cards are for storing your own information.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>ROM</STRONG> cards are pre-programmed and are normally called
			applications; for example PCLINK.
		</P>
		<P><STRONG>EPROM</STRONG> cards allow you to write information once only, but
			retain it even when removed from the machine thus providing a secure way of
			saving your data.
		</P>
		<H3>Card information - <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CARD
		</H3>
		<P>The <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CARD
			command, on the Index <STRONG>COMMANDS</STRONG> menu, shows the type and size
			of the card in each slot. However it will not show an erased EPROM until it has
			been accessed by the Filer.
		</P>
		<H3>Inserting or removing cards</H3>
		<P>Cards should only be inserted or removed with the Cambridge Z88 switched on.</P>
		<P>First enter the Index. Then open the perspex flap at the front of the machine.
			Check that the screen goes blank. The computer should bleep once as you open
			the flap. The card can then be pushed in or pulled out. The label on the end of
			the card should be upright when you push the card home. When you have completed
			the operation, push the Perspex flap back into position.
		</P>
		<H3>Card errors</H3>
		<P>Errors which occur during the insertion or removal of cards are displayed in the <STRONG>
				OZ</STRONG> position at the left-hand side of the screen.
		</P>
		<P>A
			<span class="screen" style="COLOR: #ffffff; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">
				FAIL</span>
			message is given if a RAM card is removed, indicating that a soft reset is
			necessary.
		</P>
		<P>If you remove an application card which a suspended activity is using, the
			Cambridge Z88 will give a continuous tone and flash
			<span class="screen">CARD</span>
			until the card is replaced. The suspended activity should be removed with <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">KILL
			before trying again.</P>
		<P>An
			<span class="screen">INDEX</span>
			message is given, together with a continuous tone, if you have attempted to
			remove an application card while not in the Index.
		</P>
		<H2>RAM cards</H2>
		<P>RAM cards allow you to store more data in the Cambridge Z88. There are three
			slots, each of which may take up to 1 Megabyte of RAM, although it is advisable
			to use slots 1 and 2 for RAM leaving slot 3 available for EPROM. This is
			because slot 3 is the only one which can be used to record data onto EPROM.
			Also RAM cards will consume more power in this slot than in slots 1 and 2 and
			therefore reduce battery life.
		</P>
		<H3>Inserting a RAM card</H3>
		<P>1 Make sure that the Cambridge Z88 is switched ON and the Index is displayed.</P>
		<P>2 Open the Perspex flap at the front. The Cambridge Z88 will give a short beep
			and the screen will go blank.
		</P>
		<P>3 Push the RAM pack into the slot making sure that the label is facing outwards
			and is the correct way up. Make sure that the card is pushed in as far as it
			will go.
		</P>
		<P>4 Close the flap. The Cambridge Z88 will turn itself back on and re-display the
			Index. You can check that the card has been recognised by typing <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CARD.
		</P>
		<P>If you remove a RAM pack from the Cambridge Z88 any data held in it will be lost
			instantly. Do not remove a RAM card unless you must. If you do have to remove a
			RAM card, the Cambridge Z88 will display
			<span class="screen" style="COLOR: #ffffff; BACKGROUND-COLOR: #000000">FAIL</span>
			in the top right hand corner of the screen. You will have to perform a
			soft-reset on the Cambridge Z88 and any suspended activities will be lost.
		</P>
		<H2>Using extra RAM
		</H2>
		<P>When you insert a RAM card the extra memory space which it provides will be
			instantly available to activities such as PipeDream. However, files which are
			saved in RAM must be specifically directed either to the original internal
			memory or to the extra memory provided by the card. For example, if you insert
			a RAM card in slot 1, you will need to alter the default device setting in the
			Cambridge Z88's Panel utility to cause it to be used for files.</P>
		<P>To do this enter the Panel utility by typing
		</P>
		<P><IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">S
		</P>
		<P>Then move the cursor to the default device and change the value to:</P>
		<P><span class="type">:RAM.1</span>
		</P>
		<P>Any new activities which you start will then save their data in the new RAM
			card.
		</P>
		<P>Existing activities willstill save data files in the old RAM. To cause an
			existing activity to use the new RAM, go into it and then enter the Filer by
			typing <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">F.
			Use the select device option to select the new RAM card and then return to the
			activity by pressing
			<span class="key">ESC</span>.</P>
		<P>If you have RAM cards in more than one slot you may wish to save files to each
			of them explicitly. To do this you should use the device name
			<span class="type">:RAM.1/</span>
			or
			<span class="type">:RAM2/</span>
			when specifying the filename, where the number refers to the slot in which the
			RAM card has been placed. The original memory of the Cambridge Z88 can be
			referred to as
			<span class="type">:RAM.0</span>
			in all cases.
		</P>
		<H2>EPROM cards
		</H2>
		<P>EPROM cards can only be used in slot 3. They are designed to be used for
			longterm storage of important data or programs. Unlike RAM, EPROMs will retain
			information even when removed from the Cambridge Z88. Thus, in addition to
			providing a means to make back-up copies of valuable data, EPROMs provide a
			convenient means for transferring data between Cambridge Z88s.
		</P>
		<P>One important fact to note about EPROMs is that data cannot be change once it is
			recorded into them. ff you record a file onto EPROM and then make some changes
			you will be able to record a complete new copy of the file, but this will use
			up more space within the EPROM. The space occupied by the original version will
			not became available again. When an EPROM becomes completely full in this way
			you will only be able to re-use it by erasing ALL the data which it contains.
			EPROMs cannot be partially erased.
		</P>
		<P>EPROMs may be inserted or removed at any time, except when they are actually
			being read or written to. They do not consume much power except when being
			written to, at which time the Cambridge Z88's screen will be switched off to
			conserve power.</P>
		<P>Note — It is important to remove any EPROM card from the Cambridge Z88 if you
			have to re-power a Cambridge Z88 which has been left without power. Otherwise
			there is a small risk that data on the card may be corrupted. If the EPROM
			becomes corrupted it will need to be fully erased and all the data will be
			lost. An EPROM may not be recognised by the Cambridge Z88 when you type <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CARD
			within the Index. It will be shown once you have saved a file to it. If a new
			EPROM will not catalogue, then try installing it again. If this fails, try
			erasing the EPROM.
		</P>
		<H3>EPROM eraser</H3>
		<P>The EPROM eraser will erase all the data stored in the EPROM by exposing the
			integrated circuit through the round window in the card to ultra-violet light.</P>
		<H3>WARNING</H3>
		<P>If the internal light can be seen when there is no card present the EPROM eraser
			is faulty and should be retuned.</P>
		<P>The EPROM eraser produces an intense ultra-violet light which can only be
			activated by inserting a Cambridge Z88 memory card into the eraser; this safety
			feature prevents any escape of ultra-violet light.
		</P>
		<P>REMOVE FROM MAINS SUPPLY WHEN NOT IN USE.
		</P>
		<P>Never touch the ultra-violet light source. It gets hot in use and may cause
			bums; also it is made of quartz and will cloud over due to moisture from the
			skin.
		</P>
		<H3>To erase an EPROM</H3>
		<P>1&nbsp;Connect the eraser to the domestic mains supply. The plug should be
			fitted with either a 1 Amp or a 3 Amp fuse.
		</P>
		<P>2&nbsp;Fully insert the EPROM card into the slot on the front of the eraser,
			with the round hole uppermost. The card is correctly inserted if the white
			label on the end of the card is visible and the printing "32K EPROM" or "128K
			EPROM" is <STRONG>upside down</STRONG>.
		</P>
		<P>3&nbsp;The action of inserting the card switches the eraser on. The red
			indicator light on top of the eraser should light and the EPROM will be exposed
			to ultra-violet light for approximately twenty minutes. After this time the
			ultraviolet light is automatically switched off and the red light will go out.</P>
		<P>4&nbsp;After the red light goes out, you can remove the card from the eraser. DO
			NOT REMOVE THE EPROM BEFORE THE RED LIGHT IS OUT. The EPROM card should now be
			blank and ready for re-use. Removing the card resets the timer, so to erase
			another card, simply insert it; the red indicator light will again be
			illuminated, and the process can be repeated.
		</P>
		<P>The ultra-violet light source decreases in efficiency with use and eventually a
			single 20-minute exposure may not completely erase all the data in the EPROM.
			In this case it may be a good idea to repeat the process a second time to be
			absolutely sure that it is thoroughly erased.
		</P>
		<P>There is no means of erasing selected individual parts of data from the EPROM.
			When the EPROM is exposed to the ultra-violet source all data is affected in
			the same way.
		</P>
		<H2>ROM cards</H2>
		<P>ROM cards are used to contain extra data or applications programs such as
			databases, communications programs, or spelling checkers.
		</P>
		<P>The procedure for inserting a ROM card is very similar to that for inserting a
			RAM card. First turn the Cambridge Z88 ON and enter the Index. Open the flap
			and push the card into a free slot. Close the flap. The Cambridge Z88 will take
			not of the new card, check this by typing <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CARD
			from the Index.
		</P>
		<P>To remove a ROM card the Cambridge Z88 must once again be ON and you must be in
			the Index. You must not have any suspended activities which are making use of
			the card. To check this, look at the list of activities on the display and see
			if any of them have a number in the rightmost column. If they do, and this is
			the slot number which holds the card in question, then that activity must be
			killed (using <IMG style="VERTICAL-ALIGN: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">KILL)
			before the ROM card is removed.
		</P>
		<P>If You remove a card that is in the use the Cambridge Z88 will sound a warning
			when you close the flap and display the symbol
			<span class="screen">CARD</span>
			at the top right of the screen. You must then replace the card in the same slot
			that it came from and kill all remaining activities.
		</P>
		<P>If you remove a card whilst you are not in the Index the Cambridge Z88 will
			sound a warning when you close the flap and display the symbol
			<span class="screen">INDEX</span>
			at the top right of the screen. You must return the card to the original slot,
			close the flap and return to the Index. You will then be able to remove the
			card normally.
		</P>
		<P>Do not remove ROM cards while the Cambridge Z88 is switched OFF.</P>
		<H2>Expanded/Unexpanded</H2>
		<P>The Cambridge Z88 can either be classed as an expanded or an unexpanded machine.
		</P>
		<P>An expanded machine will allow the use of a large BASIC workspace and a larger
			map size in PipeDream.
		</P>
		<P>For the Cambridge Z88 to be an expanded machine, it must satisfy one of the
			following conditions:
		</P>
		<P>
			<TABLE id="Table1" cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="1" width="500" border="1">

		</P>
		<P>To find out what version of operating system is fitted, press the
			<span class="key">INDEX</span>
