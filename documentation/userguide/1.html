        Section One - Getting started</h1>
    <p>
        Start here to find out how to get your Cambridge Z88 working for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section contains four introductory chapters:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Introducing the Cambridge Z88</strong> gives a foretaste of what the Cambridge
        Z88 can do.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Up and running</strong> explains how to insert batteries, switch on, and
        start writing your first document on the Cambridge Z88.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Applications and popdowns</strong> describes the programs provided in the
        Cambridge Z88, to help you decide which you want to learn about first. These are
        then explained more fully in the later sections.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Basic concepts</strong> explains a little more about the components of the
        Cambridge Z88: the keyboard, the display, and how the functions work.</p>
    <h1>
        Introducing the Cambridge Z88</h1>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 is a unique computer for several reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the first time in a machine of its size and portability it offers you a powerful
        productivity tool, PipeDream, capable of tackling the most demanding applications
        and providing all the capabilities normally only obtained by working with separate
        programs on much larger computers; it combines in one program most facilities provided
        by the best word processors, database programs, and spreadsheets.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complement PipeDream, the Cambridge Z88 comes complete with a range of utility
        programs, designed to anticipate any task you might wish to perform in the home
        or office; these include a clock, calculator, diary and organiser, and an alarm
        reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 also avoids the problems of storing documents and applications
        long-term by providing battery-powered circuitry which will retain all the information
        in the computer for over a year while it is switched off. The batteries also maintain
        the correct time and date in an internal clock and calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, communication with larger computers is catered for by built-in transfer
        programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In no time, the Cambridge Z88 will revolutionise your life by making it possible
        for you to work with the tools you need, wherever and whenever you want.</p>
    <h2>
        Conventions in this manual</h2>
    <p>
        In this manual, anything displayed on the Cambridge Z88 screen is shown in a computer
        typeface, such as
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to save</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Anything that you should type at the keyboard is shown in a different typeface to
        designate the keyboard keys; for example
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">You are invited to a party</span></p>
    <p>
        The keys on the keyboard with a special function are shown in the text with key
        legends. So, for example, if you are asked to type</p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">myfile</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span></p>
    <p>
        you would actually type the letters <span class="type">m y f i l e</span> and then
        press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, references to menu headings are in bold caps; for example <strong>LAYOUT</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        References to individual commands are in bold; for example <strong>Save</strong>
        or <strong>Load</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        References to options displayed by a command are in italics; for example <em>Save only
            range of columns</em>.</p>
    <h1>
        Up and running</h1>
    <p>
        This section will explain how to get your Cambridge Z88 working for you as soon
        as possible. Once you have tried out the simple examples in the next few pages you
        should have a feel for what the Cambridge Z88 can do for you, before proceeding
        to the later sections at your leisure.</p>
    <h2>
        Fitting batteries</h2>
    To run the Cambridge Z88 you will need the following batteries:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>Four alkaline cells, Size AA, type MN1500 or LR6. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Other types of the same size can be used in an emergency, but we recommend the use
        of the leak-resistant alkaline type as these will keep your Cambridge Z88 working
        for longer without needing replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
        With these batteries an unexpanded Cambridge Z88 will give about 20 hours of active
        computing, and the data will be preserved in the machine while it is switched off
        for up to a year.
    </p>
    <p>
        For heavy indoor use the mains power unit is recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note that the procedure described here is not the same as the one for replacing
            existing batteries. In this case refer to Appendix A.</strong></p>
    <h2>
        Inserting the batteries</h2>
    <p>
        The four batteries are housed in a row in the battery compartment, under a flap
        on the rear of the Cambridge Z88 case.</p>
    <p>
    <img src="images/007.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        To insert batteries for the first time, use the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Remove the cover from the battery compartment on the back of the Cambridge Z88
        case, and insert one battery at each end of the compartment.
        <br />
        Make sure the batteries are fitted the correct way round, as indicated by the diagram
        in the battery compartment.</li>
        <li>Insert the remaining two batteries to make an 'A' shape above the case. Make
        sure that all four batteries are facing in the same direction, with the correct
        polarity.
            <br />
        Then push down on the two batteries so that they click into place.</li>
        <li>Replace the battery compartment cover firmly.</li>
    </ol>
    <img src="images/007_2.png" />
    <h2>
        Initialise the Cambridge Z88</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the transparent cover to the card slots.
            <li>Locate the reset button, which is situated behind a hole on the left-hand edge of
                the Cambridge Z88 case.<br />
                <img src="images/008.png" />
                <li>Press the reset button twice, using an unbent paperclip to reach into the hole.<br />
                    <img src="images/008_2.png" />
                    <li>Close the card slot cover. This gives a hard reset, initialising the Cambridge Z88
                        to make it ready for use. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Adjust the display</h2>
    <p>
        <img src="images/008_3.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Turn the contrast control as far towards the top of the Cambridge Z88 case as
        it will go (ie clockwise).</li>
        <li>The screen should display a dark blue rectangle.</li>
        <li>Gradually turn back the control until you can see the Cambridge Z88 screen clearly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Set the clock</h2>
    <p>
        When you first install batteries you will need to use the Clock popdown to set the
        correct date and time using the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Press
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />
            T to enter the clock popdown.
            <li>Press
                <img alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" style="vertical-align: middle">
                to highlight the <em>Set</em> option:<br />
                <img src="images/009.png" />
                <li>Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to enter the Set function, which displays the
                    previous (incorrect) date and time, and will allow you to alter these to their correct
                    values:<br />
                    <img src="images/009_2.png" /><br />
                    You can move the cursor between the time and date with
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
                    and
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />.<br />
                    You can also move the cursor left and right along the digits with the
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
                    and
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />
                    keys. Moving off the end of the date will position the cursor on the time, and vice
                    versa.
                    <li>Having positioned the cursor, simply type the correct time or date, using the numeric
                        keys 0 to 9. The format of the new time and date should not change; if you type
                        over the '/' or ':' signs, move the cursor back with the
                        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
                        key and replace them.<br />
                        <br />
                        When you have set the correct values, press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to confirm
                        them, and after about two seconds the correct time and date will be displayed.<br />
                        <br />
                        Finally, press <span class="key">ESC</span> to exit from the Clock. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Try typing text</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Hold down the
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />
            key (at the bottom left of the keyboard) and press the P key, to enter PipeDream.<br />
            <img src="images/010.png" />
            <li>Type <span class="type">Dear Sir,</span> at the keyboard. Press the <span class="key">
                DEL</span> key to delete mistakes. If you type more than will fit on one line, PipeDream
                will automatically lay out the text for you.<br />
                <img src="images/010_2.png" />
                <li>Return to the Index by pressing the <span class="key">INDEX</span> key. Your letter
                    will be kept as a suspended activity; go back to it by pressing
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />P again. You are now ready to proceed with the examples of using the Cambridge Z88
                    in the following sections. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Switch off</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>There is usually no need to worry about switching your Cambridge Z88 off. </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not type anything for several minutes the machine will automatically switch
        off to conserve power.</p>
    <p>
        You should always switch your Cambridge Z88 off before, for example, carrying it
        in a briefcase. This is because the keys may get pressed, disturbing • what you
        were in the middle of doing, or keeping the Cambridge Z88 on and wasting the batteries.
    </p>
    <p>
        To switch off press both <span class="key">SHIFT</span> keys simultaneously.</p>
    <p>
        To switch the Cambridge Z88 on again at any time, press both <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
        keys simultaneously.</p>
    <h1>
        Applications and popdowns</h1>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 comes with two types of built-in program, called <strong>applications</strong>
        and <strong>popdowns</strong>. For most of your work, you will probably use the
        <strong>applications</strong>, for writing text, setting up financial calculations,
        or organising information and appointments.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>popdowns</strong> perform simpler tasks, and are equivalent to desktop
        tools. They can be called up from within any application whenever you need them,
        and in the cases of the alarm clock, calculator and calendar, will generally be
        most useful for making a rapid check or record of information. So, in the middle
        of typing a letter, for example, you could use the Calculator to perform a quick
        calculation, and then return immediately to the letter by pressing <span class="key">
            ESC</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can keep several unfinished documents in your Cambridge Z88 at once: when you
        return to one of them to continue working on it, everything will be exactly as you
        left it. The Cambridge Z88 is designed to leave you free to do things in whatever
        order you wish, and whenever you want. It does the work, and leaves you free to
        get on with the thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next few pages will give an overview of what the Cambridge Z88 applications
        and popdowns can do. The TUTORIAL, in Sections Two, Three, and Four, then gives
        fuller descriptions of each application and popdown, with examples of their use.</p>
    <h2>
        The applications</h2>
    <p>
        The following applications are provided in the Cambridge Z88:
    </p>
    <h3>
        Creating documents - PipeDream</h3>
    <p>
        A typewriter may enable you to type in text, correct mistakes as you type them,
        and underline text, but as soon as you need to make revisions, you inevitably have
        to retype parts of what you have already written.
    </p>
    <p>
        In <strong>PipeDream</strong> you can carry out proof corrections, sorting operations,
        and complex calculations with a few keystrokes, without you having to retype any
        of the text.</p>
    <p>
        Some facilities, such as the ability to move blocks of text around, will be familiar
        to anyone who has already used another word processor. Other features, like the
        ability to put a list of items into numerical order or the ability to perform calculations
        on tables of values, are normally only found on specialist pieces of software specifically
        designed for these tasks.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Organising your time - Diary
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Diary program provides a quick way of organising events, and keeping day-to-day
        information, such as expenses. Like a desktop diary, there is a page for each day,
        on which you can write engagements and other information. But the Cambridge Z88
        diary also caters for the likelihood that you might want to find something you wrote
        down on a previous occasion; if you cannot remember even the month of a particular
        exhibition, just search for 'exhibition' and the Diary will find the page for you.
        You can also print out entries of a certain type, which makes it easy to produce
        expense claims, or worksheets.</p>
    <h3>
        Writing a program - BBC BASIC
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 comes complete with the <strong>BBC BASIC</strong> programming
        language which will allow you to program the computer to carry out sequences of
        instructions. For example, if you wanted to process some complicated statistical
        data, or convert the format of a file, the simplest way to do this might be to write
        a program using BBC BASIC.
    </p>
    <p>
        BBC BASIC is also an ideal language for learning to program, and many books on programming
        are available for use with it.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Talking to another computer - Terminal
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Terminal application allows you to set up a conversation with another computer,
        using the VT52 standard. With a modem, this will allow you to access information
        databases via a telephone line.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Create a printer driver - PrinterEd
    </h3>
    <p>
        The applications will print on any serial printer connected to the Cambridge Z88,
        but to make full use of a particular printer's capabilities, such as special fonts
        and highlighting features, you may want to create your own driver selecting whichever
        features you require. The PrinterEd application makes this a simple task.</p>
    <h2>
        The popdowns
    </h2>
    <p>
        Popdowns are programs you can call from within an application, to perform a service
        without breaking off from what you are doing.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Managing resources - Index
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Index popdown is the key to all other Cambridge Z88 applications and popdowns.
        From here you can call any other application or popdown, or resume an activity you
        suspended on a previous occasion. The Index also contains the Card Manager, which
        shows what memory cards or plug-in applications are present in the Cambridge Z88,
        and allows you to insert or remove cards.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Performing rapid calculations - Calculator
    </h3>
    <p>
        You can use the Calculator to make quick calculations -even if you are in the middle
        of doing something else at the time. Its features include ten memories, and aunits-conversion
        facility. So, for example, you can convert from litres to gallons with a few key-presses.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Looking up dates - Calendar
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Calendar means that you can plan your appointments for the coming weeks at a
        glance; and when you need to make a Diary entry, you can use the Calendar with the
        Diary to find the day you want immediately (see pp. 69-70 for details).</p>
    <h3>
        Knowing the time - Clock
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Clock will show you the time and date instantly, without your having to look
        away from whatever else you are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        All files and suspended activities are labelled with the time and date, so be sure
        that you have set the clock before you use the Cambridge Z88.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Remembering appointments - Alarm
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Alarm application allows you to set up a number of alarm reminders, with a given
        time and, if required, date. Each reminder can include a message, and reminders
        can be programmed to alert you at the same time every day, month, or other interval.
        You can even set the alarm to run a program.</p>
    <h3>
        Working with files - Filer
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Filer gives you access to the Cambridge Z88 filing system, where you can store
        documents and BBC BASIC programs in the Cambridge Z88 RAM, or for more permanent
        storage on an EPROM card. Although the filing system supports a flexible hierarchical
        directory structure, for simple applications directories can be ignored.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Customise the Cambridge Z88 - Panel
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Panel is a set of controls for the Cambridge Z88, allowing you to tailor the
        way that the keyboard, filing system, sound, and serial interface work to your own
        preferences.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Transferring files to another computer - Import/Export
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Import/Export popdown enables you to transfer documents to or from another computer,
        using a simple set of commands.</p>
    <h1>
        Basic concepts</h1>
    <p>
        Before trying an application on the Cambridge Z88, you need to be familiar with
        the basic concepts which are common to all applications. These involve selecting
        what you want to do, be it running an application or performing an operation within
        an application, and then carrying it out with the appropriate command from the keyboard.</p>
    <h2>
        The keyboard</h2>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 keyboard looks like a normal typewriter keyboard with the familiar
        gwerty arrangement of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/015.png" />
    </p>
    There are some additional keys on each side of the keyboard which have the special
    functions explained below.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>
        The letter and number keys</h3>
    <p>
        Press the letter keys alone to give the lower-case letters, or with <span class="key">
            SHIFT</span> to get capitals. You can get capitals without needing to hold down
        <span class="key">SHIFT</span> by pressing <span class="key">CAPSLOCK</span> - see
        below.</p>
    <p>
        Press the digit keys on the top row of the keyboard to give the digits, or with&nbsp;<span
            class="key">SHIFT</span> to give the symbol above each digit on the key.</p>
    <p>
        Vote that, unlike on some typewriters, the letter O is quite different in meaning
        Yom the digit 0, and the letter l (lower-case L) from the digit 1.</p>
    <h3>
        On the left-hand side of the keyboard:

        Entering PipeDream or BBC BASIC from the Index APPLICATIONS list creates a new,
        blank document.
    </p>

        For example, to enter PipeDream, starting with a new blank document, move the highlighting
        bar until <span class="screen">PipeDream</span> is selected, and press the <span
            class="key">ENTER</span> key; you will then see the PipeDream screen:

        Suspended activities
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you return to the Index after creating a document in PipeDream (or writing a
        program in BBC BASIC), your activity will be suspended, and you will see it listed
        in the list of SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES. This shows the time and date you were last
        working on the document under the heading <span class="screen">WHEN SUSPENDED</span>,
        and if a name has been given to the document (with the PipeDream
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />FC
        or
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />FL
        commands, or the BASIC <span class="type">*NAME</span> command), the name will be shown in the column headed
        <span class="screen">YOUR REF</span>. You can keep as many PipeDream and BBC BASIC
        suspended activities as you want, subject to the available memory.</p>
    <h3>
        Re-entering a suspended activity

    <p>
        You can re-enter a suspended activity by selecting it on the list of SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES.

            alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />
        key if necessary, and then press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key. Alternatively,
        pressing<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />P
        or

        Killing activities -
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL
    </h3>
    <p>
        Each suspended activity does, of course, use up some memory space; some for the
        document you are working on, plus a small overhead needed by the application. You
        can therefore kill activities you no longer need to work on in order to free the
        memory space. Save the document (or program) first if you may need it again.
    </p>
    <p>
        To kill a suspended activity, select it on the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES list with the
        cursor, and type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL.
        The activity will be removed from the list, and any document (or program) associated
        with it will be lost.</p>
    <h2>
        Using menus</h2>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 applications, and some popdowns, use menus to show you what operations
        are available at any stage, and to give you a simple way of choosing the one you
        want from among them. In keeping with the philosophy of the Cambridge Z88, menus
        free you from having to remember cryptic sequences of commands to be typed from
        the keyboard, and allow you to do what you want as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The items on each menu all relate to one particular type of operation. For example,
        all the operations to do with printing are listed on a <strong>PRINT</strong> menu.
        The menu headings are shown on the Menu List, which is displayed on the left-hand
        side of the screen under the name of the application or popdown.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use menus you have to:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Select the menu you want from the menu list.</li>
        <li>Select the operation you want to perform from that menu.</li>
        <li>Execute the operation. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These three steps are now explained in greater detail.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Selecting a menu</h3>
    <p>
        As an example of using menus, try using the menus in the PipeDream application.
        First enter PipeDream from the Index as already described.
    </p>
    <p>
        The menus available in any application are listed at the left-hand side of the screen,
        under the application name.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the menus in PipeDream are given under the heading <span class="screen">
            PIPEDREAM</span>. Each title refers to one type of operation you can perform
        with PipeDream. For example, the first menu, the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu, contains
        operations you can perform on a block of text.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the&nbsp;<span class="key">MENU</span> key will display this menu, and
        <span class="screen">BLOCKS</span> will be highlighted in bold letters on the Menu
        List. To look at a menu further down the list, press the <span class="key">MENU</span>
        key until you reach it. If you go past the menu you want, keep pressing the&nbsp;<span
            class="key">MENU</span> key until it circles back around to the top of the list.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="images/020.png" /></p>
    <p>
        For example, to select the <strong>FILES</strong> menu, you need to press the <span
            class="key">MENU</span> key three more times. You can always check which menu
        is displayed by the title in bold on the Menu List.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="images/021.png" /></p>
    <h3>
        Selecting an operation</h3>
    <p>
        You select a menu item by moving the highlighting bar with the cursor keys
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle"
            alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up"
                src="images/symb_up.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        until the operation you want is highlighted.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Executing the operation
    </h3>
    <p>
        To perform the highlighted operation, simply press the <span class="key">ENTER</span>
        key.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, on the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu example shown above, press the
        <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to perform the <strong>Mark Block</strong> operation.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Options</h3>
    <p>
        Many operations give you a list of options before actually carrying out the command.
        The <strong>Save</strong> command, on the <strong>FILES</strong> menu, is an example;
        press&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        to highlight the <strong>Save</strong> command. When you press the <span class="key">
            ENTER</span> key you will see the following prompts:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to save &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="background-color: black;">&nbsp;</span><br />

    </p>
    <p>
        In this case you can simply type in a file name, such as
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to save &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Myfile<span style="background-color: black;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
    <p>
        and press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to carry out the <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        The other options under the <strong>Save</strong> command have only two possibilities
        each, <span class="screen">Yes</span> and <span class="screen">No</span>. You can
        alternate between them in two different ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Type <span class="type">Y</span> for <span class="screen">Yes</span> and <span
            class="type">N</span> for <span class="screen">No</span> as appropriate.
    </li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Next Option</strong> or
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />J
        command to display the alternative value. (With options which have specific values,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />J
        will restore the default; see <strong>Setting the options</strong>, p. 101, for
        more details.) </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        Escaping from an operation
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you decide against performing an operation from the menu, press the <span class="key">
            ESC</span> key and the menu will disappear from the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may take you a little while to become familiar with using the menu operations
        to carry out your wishes, but once you have mastered menus you will be able to use
        all of the applications on the Cambridge Z88 without difficulty.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Short cuts -
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /></h2>
    <p>
        Menus make it easy to locate what you want to do even if you are not familiar with
        an application. But with a little experience you will find you know exactly which
        operation you want to carry out, and so will appreciate the short cuts which allow
        you to carry out any action without going through a menu.</p>
    <p>
        Each operation can be called up by typing the special
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />
        key (called 'diamond'), followed by a sequence of one or more letters. When you
        type a&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />
        sequence, the operation will be carried out instantly, no matter what you were doing
        in the application. If you do not keep the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle"
            alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />
        key held down while you are entering a&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond"
            src="images/symb_diamond.png" />
        sequence, the letters are shown at the right-hand side of the screen as a reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short cuts are shown on each menu so that you can refer to them if necessary.
        For example, the short cut for the <strong>Save</strong> operation, shown on the
        <strong>FILES</strong> menu above, is
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />FS.
        Also, the most useful of these operations are shown on the list of key functions
        above the Cambridge Z88 keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
        Note:</em> Normally
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />
        and&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />
        may be used either by holding them down whilst typing the sequence, or by pressing
        and releasing them and then typing the sequence. There are two exceptions to this;
        these are
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />ESC
        and
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />ESC
        where they must be held down.</p>
    <h2>
        Line editing</h2>
    <p>
        In most situations where you are entering a line of text in the Cambridge Z88, such
        as in response to a prompt, the following commands are available to make corrections
        and alterations to what you are typing:</p>
    <p>

    <h2>
        Memory low condition</h2>
    <p>
        When you have almost filled the Cambridge Z88 memory, with applications or data,
        the menu-selection of commands is automatically disabled to conserve memory. The
        highlight bar disappears, and the prompt display, at the right-hand side of all
        menu screens, changes to indicate that menu commands can no longer be selected with
        the cursor keys:</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="images/023.png" /></p>
    <p>
        In the memory-low condition the command short cuts must be used until enough memory
        has been freed from the machine.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Soft and hard reset</h2>
    <h3>
        Soft reset</h3>
    <p>
        In the unlikely situation of the Cambridge Z88 not responding to any keyboard Input
        it can be given a soft reset. This will remove all the suspended applications in
        the Cambridge Z88, and clear any temporary work space being used by the operating
        system, but should retain all files.</p>
    <p>
        To give a soft reset, press the reset button twice. The display will briefly show</p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">SOFT RESET ...</span></p>
    <p>
        and then return to the Index. The operating system does its best to retain all files
        in the internal or external memory, and usually succeeds.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Hard reset</h3>
    <p>
        Hard reset completely initialises the Cambridge Z88, clearing all memory, losing
        all files, and resetting the clock. Hard reset is described in <strong>Initialise the
            Cambridge Z88</strong>, p. 8. After a hard reset the Cambridge Z88 will display</p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">HARD RESET ...</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Help</h2>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 contains a Help system with highly-structured information on many
        operations and facilities provided by the machine. The problem new users of a computer
        often face is that they need to find out how to do something but are not quite sure
        where to look. The Cambridge Z88 Help system overcomes this problem by allowing
        you to 'browse', from Help information on one topic to information on related ones
        which might also provide_ the information you require. The help information is limited
        on the basic machine, but there is the provision of extending it with a Help application
        card.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Getting help</h3>
    <p>
        To find out information about a particular topic all you have to do is press the&nbsp;<span
            class="key">HELP</span> key at the bottom left-hand side of the keyboard. The
        Help system will then automatically give you information on the menu or operation
        within the application you are currently using.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Browsing within Help</h3>

    <h1>
        Using cards</h1>
    <p>
        There are three types of card for use with the Cambridge Z88:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>RAM</strong> cards are for storing your own information.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ROM</strong> cards are pre-programmed and are normally called applications;
        for example PCLINK.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>EPROM</strong> cards allow you to write information once only, but retain
        it even when removed from the machine thus providing a secure way of saving your
        data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Card information -
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CARD
    </h3>
    <p>
        The
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CARD
        command, on the Index <strong>COMMANDS</strong> menu, shows the type and size of
        the card in each slot. However it will not show an erased EPROM until it has been
        accessed by the Filer.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Inserting or removing cards</h3>
    <p>
        Cards should only be inserted or removed with the Cambridge Z88 switched on.</p>
    <p>
        First enter the Index. Then open the perspex flap at the front of the machine. Check
        that the screen goes blank. The computer should bleep once as you open the flap.
        The card can then be pushed in or pulled out. The label on the end of the card should
        be upright when you push the card home. When you have completed the operation, push
        the Perspex flap back into position.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Card errors</h3>
    <p>
        Errors which occur during the insertion or removal of cards are displayed in the
        <strong>OZ</strong> position at the left-hand side of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <span class="screen" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000">FAIL</span>
        message is given if a RAM card is removed, indicating that a soft reset is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you remove an application card which a suspended activity is using, the Cambridge
        Z88 will give a continuous tone and flash <span class="screen">CARD</span> until
        the card is replaced. The suspended activity should be removed with
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL
        before trying again.</p>
    <p>
        An <span class="screen">INDEX</span> message is given, together with a continuous
        tone, if you have attempted to remove an application card while not in the Index.
    </p>
    <h2>
        RAM cards</h2>
    <p>
        RAM cards allow you to store more data in the Cambridge Z88. There are three slots,
        each of which may take up to 1 Megabyte of RAM, although it is advisable to use
        slots 1 and 2 for RAM leaving slot 3 available for EPROM. This is because slot 3
        is the only one which can be used to record data onto EPROM. Also RAM cards will
        consume more power in this slot than in slots 1 and 2 and therefore reduce battery
        life.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Inserting a RAM card</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Make sure that the Cambridge Z88 is switched ON and the Index is displayed.</li>
        <li>Open the Perspex flap at the front. The Cambridge Z88 will give a short beep and
        the screen will go blank. </li>
        <li>Push the RAM pack into the slot making sure that the label is facing outwards
        and is the correct way up. Make sure that the card is pushed in as far as it will
        go.
        </li>
        <li>Close the flap. The Cambridge Z88 will turn itself back on and re-display the
        Index. You can check that the card has been recognised by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CARD.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you remove a RAM pack from the Cambridge Z88 any data held in it will be lost
        instantly. Do not remove a RAM card unless you must. If you do have to remove a
        RAM card, the Cambridge Z88 will display <span class="screen" style="color: #ffffff;
            background-color: #000000">FAIL</span> in the top right hand corner of the screen.
        You will have to perform a soft-reset on the Cambridge Z88 and any suspended activities
        will be lost.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Using extra RAM
    </h2>
    <p>
        When you insert a RAM card the extra memory space which it provides will be instantly
        available to activities such as PipeDream. However, files which are saved in RAM
        must be specifically directed either to the original internal memory or to the extra
        memory provided by the card. For example, if you insert a RAM card in slot 1, you
        will need to alter the default device setting in the Cambridge Z88's Panel utility
        to cause it to be used for files.</p>
    <p>
        To do this enter the Panel utility by typing
    </p>
    <p>
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />S
    </p>
    <p>
        Then move the cursor to the default device and change the value to:</p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">:RAM.1</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any new activities which you start will then save their data in the new RAM card.
    </p>
    <p>
        Existing activities willstill save data files in the old RAM. To cause an existing
        activity to use the new RAM, go into it and then enter the Filer by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />F.
        Use the select device option to select the new RAM card and then return to the activity
        by pressing <span class="key">ESC</span>.</p>
    <p>
        If you have RAM cards in more than one slot you may wish to save files to each of
        them explicitly. To do this you should use the device name <span class="type">:RAM.1/</span>
        or <span class="type">:RAM2/</span> when specifying the filename, where the number
        refers to the slot in which the RAM card has been placed. The original memory of
        the Cambridge Z88 can be referred to as <span class="type">:RAM.0</span> in all
        cases.
    </p>
    <h2>
        EPROM cards
    </h2>
    <p>
        EPROM cards can only be used in slot 3. They are designed to be used for longterm
        storage of important data or programs. Unlike RAM, EPROMs will retain information
        even when removed from the Cambridge Z88. Thus, in addition to providing a means
        to make back-up copies of valuable data, EPROMs provide a convenient means for transferring
        data between Cambridge Z88s.
    </p>
    <p>
        One important fact to note about EPROMs is that data cannot be change once it is
        recorded into them. ff you record a file onto EPROM and then make some changes you
        will be able to record a complete new copy of the file, but this will use up more
        space within the EPROM. The space occupied by the original version will not became
        available again. When an EPROM becomes completely full in this way you will only
        be able to re-use it by erasing ALL the data which it contains. EPROMs cannot be
        partially erased.
    </p>
    <p>
        EPROMs may be inserted or removed at any time, except when they are actually being
        read or written to. They do not consume much power except when being written to,
        at which time the Cambridge Z88's screen will be switched off to conserve power.</p>
    <p>
        Note - It is important to remove any EPROM card from the Cambridge Z88 if you have
        to re-power a Cambridge Z88 which has been left without power. Otherwise there is
        a small risk that data on the card may be corrupted. If the EPROM becomes corrupted
        it will need to be fully erased and all the data will be lost. An EPROM may not
        be recognised by the Cambridge Z88 when you type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CARD
        within the Index. It will be shown once you have saved a file to it. If a new EPROM
        will not catalogue, then try installing it again. If this fails, try erasing the
        EPROM.
    </p>
    <h3>
        EPROM eraser</h3>
    <p>
        The EPROM eraser will erase all the data stored in the EPROM by exposing the integrated
        circuit through the round window in the card to ultra-violet light.</p>
    <h3>
        WARNING</h3>
    <p>
        If the internal light can be seen when there is no card present the EPROM eraser
        is faulty and should be retuned.</p>
    <p>
        The EPROM eraser produces an intense ultra-violet light which can only be activated
        by inserting a Cambridge Z88 memory card into the eraser; this safety feature prevents
        any escape of ultra-violet light.
    </p>
    <p>
        REMOVE FROM MAINS SUPPLY WHEN NOT IN USE.
    </p>
    <p>
        Never touch the ultra-violet light source. It gets hot in use and may cause bums;
        also it is made of quartz and will cloud over due to moisture from the skin.
    </p>
    <h3>
        To erase an EPROM</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>
        Connect the eraser to the domestic mains supply. The plug should be fitted
        with either a 1 Amp or a 3 Amp fuse.
    </li>
        <li>Fully insert the EPROM card into the slot on the front of the eraser, with
        the round hole uppermost. The card is correctly inserted if the white label on the
        end of the card is visible and the printing "32K EPROM" or "128K EPROM" is <strong>upside
            down</strong>. </li>
        <li>The action of inserting the card switches the eraser on. The red indicator
        light on top of the eraser should light and the EPROM will be exposed to ultra-violet
        light for approximately twenty minutes. After this time the ultraviolet light is
        automatically switched off and the red light will go out.</li>
        <li>After the red light goes out, you can remove the card from the eraser. DO
        NOT REMOVE THE EPROM BEFORE THE RED LIGHT IS OUT. The EPROM card should now be blank
        and ready for re-use. Removing the card resets the timer, so to erase another card,
        simply insert it; the red indicator light will again be illuminated, and the process
        can be repeated. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The ultra-violet light source decreases in efficiency with use and eventually a
        single 20-minute exposure may not completely erase all the data in the EPROM. In
        this case it may be a good idea to repeat the process a second time to be absolutely
        sure that it is thoroughly erased.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no means of erasing selected individual parts of data from the EPROM. When
        the EPROM is exposed to the ultra-violet source all data is affected in the same
        way.

    <h2>
        ROM cards</h2>
    <p>
        ROM cards are used to contain extra data or applications programs such as databases,
        communications programs, or spelling checkers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The procedure for inserting a ROM card is very similar to that for inserting a RAM
        card. First turn the Cambridge Z88 ON and enter the Index. Open the flap and push
        the card into a free slot. Close the flap. The Cambridge Z88 will take not of the
        new card, check this by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CARD
        from the Index.
    </p>
    <p>
        To remove a ROM card the Cambridge Z88 must once again be ON and you must be in
        the Index. You must not have any suspended activities which are making use of the
        card. To check this, look at the list of activities on the display and see if any
        of them have a number in the rightmost column. If they do, and this is the slot
        number which holds the card in question, then that activity must be killed (using
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL)
        before the ROM card is removed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If You remove a card that is in the use the Cambridge Z88 will sound a warning when
        you close the flap and display the symbol <span class="screen">CARD</span> at the
        top right of the screen. You must then replace the card in the same slot that it
        came from and kill all remaining activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you remove a card whilst you are not in the Index the Cambridge Z88 will sound
        a warning when you close the flap and display the symbol <span class="screen">INDEX</span>
        at the top right of the screen. You must return the card to the original slot, close
        the flap and return to the Index. You will then be able to remove the card normally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not remove ROM cards while the Cambridge Z88 is switched OFF.</p>
    <h2>
        Expanded/Unexpanded</h2>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 can either be classed as an expanded or an unexpanded machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        An expanded machine will allow the use of a large BASIC workspace and a larger map
        size in PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Cambridge Z88 to be an expanded machine, it must satisfy one of the following
        conditions:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="frames">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Operating System Version No.</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>At least 128R RAM in:</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Earlier than 4.0<br />
                    4.0 or later</td>
                <td>
                    Slot 1 only<br />
                    Internal RAM or Slot 1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        To find out what version of operating system is fitted, press the <span class="key">
            INDEX</span> key and then the&nbsp;<span class="key">HELP</span> key. When you
        then press the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
        key, the Cambridge Z88 will display the Operating System version number. Press&nbsp;<span
            class="key">ESC</span> to return.to the Index.</p>
