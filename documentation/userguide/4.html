Section Four - Using the popdowns
    </h1>
    <p>
The Cambridge Z88 popdowns are utility programs that you can make use of 
while you are working within another application, such as PipeDream, the Diary, 
or BBC BASIC. They pop down over your application screen, and disappear 
again when you press <span class="key">ESC</span> to return to the application.
    </p>
    <p>
The following popdowns are provided in the Cambridge Z88:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/072.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
The top line of the calculator displays the result of your calculation - initially 
0.00 - and below that are the calculator keys. You can press these in either of 
two ways, depending on your preference.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Either:</em> Use  the cursor keys <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" /> <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" /> to highlight the operation you want, and 
then press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to enter the selected key.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Or:</em> Type the Cambridge Z88 key corresponding to the key you want, as listed

    <h2>
        Entering numbers
    </h2>
    <p>
Enter a number by selecting the digits with the cursor keys, and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> ; or 
just type the number with the keys 0-9. You can use C or <span class="key">DEL</span> to correct typing 
mistakes. Numbers can contain a decimal point, obtained by typing the full-stop 
key, and can be entered in scientific notation, as in
    </p>
    <p>
1.27E6, entered as <span class="type">1 . 2 7 E 6</span>, which means 1.27 x 10<sup>6</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
7.1E-13, entered as <span class="type">7 . 1 E 1 1 3</span>, which means 7.1 x 10<sup>-13</sup>.</p>
    <p>
The two operands of an operation can be exchanged, before pressing =, by 
selecting the Y<>x operation, or pressing Y. For example, to find the reciprocal 
of a previous calculation, enter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">/ 1 Y =</span>
    </p>
    <p>
All calculations are performed to an accuracy of nine decimal places, and 
numbers can lie between 1E38 and 1E-38. The Calculator displays <span class="screen">Error</span>
        if an 
error, such as 1/0, occurs.
    </p>
    <h2>
Display format
    </h2>
    <p>
        The format in which numbers are displayed can be altered with the <em>Fix</em> operation,
        which gives the prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
Fix? </span>
    </p>
    <p>
Typing a number between 0 and 8 will fix the number of decimal places 
displayed to the specified number; the initial value is 2. Typing 9 will give free 
format.
    </p>
    <h2>
Constants
    </h2>
    <p>
Entering a number, followed by one of the arithmetic keys pressed twice, stores 
the operation as a constant operation and displays the operator with K at the 
top right-hand corner of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, entering
    </p>
    <p class="type">
        <span>
1.15 * *</span>
    </p>
    <p>
sets up constant multiplication by 1.15, and displays <span class="screen">
            * K</span>; entering
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">
1000 = </span>
    </p>
    <p>
then gives the result 1150.00, and
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">
2000 = </span>
    </p>
    <p>
gives the result 2300.00.
    </p>
    <h2>
Storing and Recalling
    </h2>
    <p>
You can store a result for use later in a calculation with the StoM and RclM 
operations.
    </p>
    <p>
To store a result, select the StoM operation (or type S). The prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen"">StoM ?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
will be given, to which you should give a register number by typing a digit from 
0 to 9. Up to ten different results can be stored, one in each register.
    </p>
    <p>
You can also add a result into a register, subtract a result from a register, 
multiply a register by a result, or divide a register by a result, by giving the 
StoM operation followed by '+', '-', '*', or '/' respectively, followed by the 
register 0 to 9.
    </p>
    <p>
You can cancel a store operation in the middle by pressing <span class="key">ESC</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example,
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">1.2 S 9</span>
    </p>
    <p>
stores 1.2 in register 9, and
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">
3.56 S-9 </span>
    </p>
    <p>
subtracts 3.56 from the same register. Finally
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">R 9 </span>
    </p>
    <p>
recalls the result from register 9.
    </p>
    <h2>
Percentages
    </h2>
    <p>
The '%' key works in conjunction with one of the other keys '*', '/', '+', or '-' to 
calculate percentages, and to add or subtract a given percentage to or from a 
number. The following examples illustrate each of these cases.
    </p>
    <p>
To find 12% of 1500 enter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">
1500 * 12 %</span>
    </p>
    <p>
To express 660/880 as a percentage, enter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">
660 / 880 %</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        To add 15% on to 125 enter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">125 * 15 % +</span>
    </p>
    <p>
Likewise, to discount 125 by 15% enter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">125 * 15 % -</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
Converting units
    </h2>
    <p>
You can convert any result between the pairs of units displayed on the <strong>CONVERT</strong>
        menu by selecting the <em>Unit</em> operation.
    </p>
    <p>
Highlight the unit you want to convert to using the cursor keys, and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> 
to perform the conversion. For example, to convert from Litres to Gallons 
highlight Gallons, and to convert from Gallons to Litres highlight Litres. To exit 
from the 
        <strong>CONVERT</strong> menu press <span class="key">ESC</span>.

    </h1>
    <p>
The Calendar provides a convenient tool for planning your engagements, 
particularly when you want to look up dates quickly without leaving the

The Calendar is accurate back to the year 1753 (when the Gregorian calendar 
was accepted in England) and so has historical applications in addition to its 
obvious business uses.

        <span class="type"">17 mar 1987</span>
    </p>
    <p>
if you find this more convenient. The Cambridge Z88 defaults to the twentieth

    </h1>
    <p>
The Clock popdown can be called whenever you need to see the correct time or

    <p>
Press <span class="key">ESC</span> to return to the current application.
    </p>
    <p>
Because you may be using the Clock popdown to time something, the 
Cambridge Z88 will not switch off after the timeout period if the clock is 
displayed on the screen.

    <h1>
The Alarm - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />A
    </h1>
    <p>
The Alarm popdown can be used to make your Cambridge Z88 remind you of 
important events or appointments, or simply to wake you up in the morning. 
Any number of alarms can be set up, and for each alarm you can specify the 
following information:
    </p>
    <h3>
        DATE
    </h3>
    <p>
        The date on which the first alarm will occur. For a new alarm this is initially
        set to the current date, or if the alarm is called from the Calendar or Diary, the
        Calendar or Diary date.
    </p>
    <h3>
        TIME
    </h3>
    <p>
The time at which the alarm will occur. For a new alarm this is set to the current 
time, but you will usually alter it to the required alarm time. All times in the 
Alarm are given in 24-hour format.
    </p>
    <h3>
REASON/COMMAND
    </h3>
    <p>
For each alarm you can specify a message of up to 23 characters, or a CLI 
command string which will be executed to cause something to happen; see 
below.
    </p>
    <p>
To set an alarm, press <span class="key">ENTER</span>. The alarms you have set up will become active as 
soon as you exit from the popdown by pressing <span class="key">ESC</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the Cambridge Z88 will not switch off automatically while the alarm popdown
        is on the screen.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Alarm options
    </h2>
    <p>
Each alarm can also have the following optional settings:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Bell:</em> can be <span class="screen">ON</span>
        or <span class="screen">OFF</span>, determining whether the Cambridge Z88 bleeper 
sounds when the alarm is activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Alarm type:</em> normally <span class="screen">
            ALARM</span>. This can be altered to <span class="screen">
                EXECUTE</span> to allow a 
command, in the <span class="screen">
                    REASON FOR ALARM</span> field, to be executed when the alarm 
is activated. Thus you could, for example, cause the Diary to be entered and a 
line of text to be typed in automatically on an alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">
#D|CT Urgent message</span>
    </p>
    <p>
For more information on executing commands, see <strong>CLI files</strong>, p. 173.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Repeat every:</em> normally set to <span class="screen">
            NEVER</span>, so that an alarm will occur just once, at 
the specified time and date. The repeat rate can be altered to one of the 
following to obtain a repeating alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
YEAR, MONTH, WEEK, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND </span>
    </p>
    <p>
You can move between these options with <span class="key">SHIFT</span> <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> and <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />; pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> or 
<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> then increases or decreases the number of the unit selected. You can thus 
specify every <span class="screen">3 HOURS</span>, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
No. of times:</em> specifies the number of times that the alarm will be repeated 
before being cancelled. It is initially set to <span class="screen">
            NEVER</span>, so that the alarm will occur 
just once. It can be set to <span class="screen"
               >FOREVER </span>by pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />, or a number from one 
upwards by pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />. Holding the <span class="key">SHIFT</span> key down while pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> or <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> 
will increase or decrease the number in tens, and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> will change it in 
hundreds.
    </p>
    <p>
By setting these fields appropriately, you can obtain almost every possible alarm 
setting. For example, to cause an alarm to occur on the 3rd March, 3rd April, and 
3rd May, at 12.00, set
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">DATE</span> <span class="type"
           >3 Mar 1987</span> <span class="screen">
                REPEAT EVERY</span> <span class="type">1 MONTH</span>
        <br />
        <span class="screen">TIME</span> <span class="type"
           >12.00</span> <span class="screen">
                NO,  OF TIMES</span> <span class="type">3</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> Do not set the alarm to repeat every second for ever. You will not be able 
to cancel it without doing a soft reset.
    </p>
    <h2>
Clearing alarms
    </h2>
    <p>
To clear an alarm, select it with the cursor keys <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> or <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> on the list of alarms,
select <span class="screen">
            CLEAR ALARM</span> with <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" /> and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />, and press <span class="key">ENTER</span>. With a repeating 
alarm this just clears the present alarm; use <span class="screen"
           >CLEAR ALARM</span> twice to remove a 
repeating alarm completely.
    </p>
    <p>
If an alarm occurs while the Cambridge Z88 is turned off, the alarm will sound 
and the Cambridge Z88 will be turned on in LOCK OUT state to prevent 
accidental key-presses. To clear this state turn the Cambridge Z88 off and then 
on again in the usual way, by pressing both <span class="key">SHIFT</span> keys.
    </p>
    <h1>
The Filer - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />F
    </h1>
    <p>
With extension RAM and EPROM cards fitted, you will have the ability to store 
many documents in your Cambridge Z88. The Filer provides everything you will 
need for organising these; in particular it allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obtain a list (<em>catalogue</em>) of all your files, or the files in the optional EPROM 
card (<strong>Catalogue Files </strong>and <strong>Catalogue EPROM</strong>).</li>
        <li>Move files to and from an EPROM, which provides permanent storage on a 
removable card in slot 3 of the Cambridge Z88 (<strong>Save to EPROM </strong>and <strong>Fetch
                from EPROM</strong>).</li>
        <li>Change the names of files within the filing system (<strong>Rename</strong>).</li>
        <li>Make additional copies of files (<strong>Copy</strong>), or remove files completely (<strong>Erase</strong>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
Other commands, for more advanced use of the Filer, are explained in the Filer 
Reference section.
    </p>
    <p>
When you have finished using the Filer, press <span class="key">ESC</span> to return to the original 
application.
    </p>
    <h3>
Hierarchical structure
    </h3>
    <p>
The Cambridge Z88 filing system is a hierarchical filing system. This means that 
you can group files together within 'directories'. This facility is akin to keeping 
similar documents in a folder within a filing cabinet, and is of great assistance in 
keeping a large number of files orderly. However, for simple use of the filing 
system you will not need to use these facilities; see the Filer Reference section 
for a full description.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> With Operating Systems up to and including 3.0 it is important that you 
only exit the Filer by pressing <span class="key">ESC</span>. In particular, if you are using <strong>Catalogue Files </strong>(<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CF) or <strong>Catalogue EPROM </strong>(<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CE) and you exit the Filer in the middle of 
the operation by using <span class="key">INDEX</span> or <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" /> followed by a letter, then one of the files can 
become marked as 'IN USE', and you will not be able to access it without 
performing a soft reset.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Entering the Filer
    </h2>
    <p>
The Filer display consists of two windows; a COMMANDS window, and a 
DIRECTORY window:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/083.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        File names
    </h2>
    <p>
Each file or directory in the filing system has a name of up to twelve letters or 
digits. This can be followed by a full stop and up to three further letters or digits 
called the extension, and is normally used to describe the type of the file. Thus a 
BASIC program could be saved as
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">game.bas</span></p>
    <p>
        where <span class="type">bas</span> is an extension used for all BASIC programs.
    </p>
    <p>
Upper- and lower-case letters are treated as equivalent in file names. In the 
catalogue window directories are displayed in a small typeface.
    </p>
    <h3>
Specifying devices
    </h3>
    <p>
When saving and loading files to and from applications, such as PipeDream, you 
will normally just give the file name and extension, if there is one. However, the 
Filer keeps a fuller description of where the file is in the system, including 
which RAM card it is on (the <em>device</em>), and several of the Filer commands will show
        this full form of the file name.
    </p>
    <p>
        The full form of a file name is
    </p>
    <p>
        :<em>DEVICE/filename </em>
    </p>
    <p>
The most useful options for <em>DEVICE</em> are:
    </p>
    <p>
        <table class="transperent">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <span class="type">
:RAM.0<br />
:RAM.1 to :RAM.3</span></td>
                <td>
                    RAM in slot 0 (internal memory)<br />
                    RAM in slots 1 to 3 (external memory)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        A full list is given in the Filer Reference section.
    </p>
    <p>
* can be used in any part of a file name to match any characters; thus
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">
game* </span>
    </p>
    <p>
represents any file name beginning with game, and
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">
:RAM.*</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        represents all the RAM in the Cambridge Z88.
    </p>
    <h2>
Giving Filer commands
    </h2>
    <p>
You can give filer commands in one of three ways, depending which you find 
most convenient:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the command from the Filer COMMANDS list, using the <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
            keys. The list of commands will scroll up if you move the cursor below the 
bottom of the screen. Then press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the command.</li>
        <li>Select the command from the <strong>COMMANDS</strong> menu with the cursor keys, and 
press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the command.</li>
        <li>Give the <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /> key sequence for the command, as listed below. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        COMMANDS menu

    <h2>
        Selecting files
    </h2>
    <p>
The Filer provides two ways of identifying the files you wish to operate on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Either:</em> Type the file name after the Filer prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen"><span>Name : </span><span
            style="background-color: black">&nbsp;</span><span>
            </span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Or:</em> Select the file or files in the catalogue window, as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Select First File -</strong> <span class="key">ENTER</span> or <span class="key">TAB</span> 
        <br />
        <strong>
Select Extra File -</strong> <span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span> or <span class="key">TAB</span> 
    </p>
    <p>
Select the  first file by highlighting the file name using the cursor keys, and press 
<span class="key">ENTER</span> (or <span class="key">TAB</span>). You can select further files, if required for an operation that can 
be performed on several files at once (eg <strong>Erase</strong>), using <span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span> (or <span class="key">TAB</span> again).
    </p>
    <p>
When selected, files are indicated by a marker to the left of the file name in the 
catalogue window, as shown in the example on p. 83.

file with the <strong>Copy</strong> command; they will be appended in the order in which they 
were selected.
    </p>
    <h3>
Rename - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />RE
    </h3>
    <p>
Allows the name of a file to be altered. Gives the prompts
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp;
        Name :
        <br />
        New name : </span>
    </p>
    <p>
For example, to change the name of a file from game.bas to 0ldversion you 
would specify
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp; Name : game.bas
            <br />
New name : oldversion</span>
    </p>
    <p>
Note that you cannot use the <strong>Rename</strong> command to move a file from one 
directory or device to another. The new name must be a simple file name; 
devices and path names are not permitted.
    </p>
    <h3>
Erase - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />ER
    </h3>
    <p>
        Allows one or more files to be removed from the filing system. Gives the prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name :</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        followed by the prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
Confirm each file ? Yes</span>
    </p>
    <p>
Pressing <span class="key">ENTER</span> will prompt for each file you have selected to be erased, so 
allowing you to change your decision for any particular file. Alternatively,
changing the option to <span class="screen">No</span> by typing <span class="type">N</span>
        will erase all the selected files without 
further prompting.
    </p>
    <p>
You will not be permitted to erase a file which is in use; for example, a directory 
containing other files, or an open BASIC file.
    </p>
    <p>
Files can only be erased from the EPROM with the ultra-violet EPROM eraser.
    </p>
    <p>
Note that because parts of an erased file may still be present, you should not 
rely on the <strong>Erase</strong> command for disposing of confidential information from the 
system.
    </p>
    <h3>
Advanced Filer commands
    </h3>
    <p>
The remaining Filer commands are for advanced use of the Filer, and the 
hierarchical directory structure; these are explained in the <strong>Section Seven - Filer Reference</strong>,
        p. 169.
    </p>
    <h1>
The Panel - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />S
    </h1>
    <p>
The Panel popdown allows you to set up aspects of the Cambridge Z88's 
operation to suit your own preferences. You can alter the rate at which keys on 
the keyboard auto-repeat when you hold them down, the time after which the 
Cambridge Z88 will automatically switch off, the default device and directory 
used by the Filer, and the parameters for the serial interface.
    </p>
    <p>
You can call up the panel by typing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />S (for Settings).
    </p>
    <h2>
Altering the panel
    </h2>
    <p>
To alter an option on the panel, first select it by moving the cursor to the 
appropriate line with the cursor keys <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />, <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />, <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" /> and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />.
        Then type in the new 
value for the option, and press <span class="key">ENTER</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
In the case of options with alternative values you can also select between the 
alternatives by giving the <strong>Next Option </strong>command, <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />J, or you can specify the 
option you want by typing the option's first letter.
    </p>
    <p>
You can save a particular set of panel settings in a panel file, using the <strong>Save</strong>
        command on the <strong>FILES</strong> menu. Selecting the <strong>New</strong> command
        on the <strong>FILES</strong> menu 
returns the settings to their initial values.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Panel options
    </h2>
    <p>
For each of the following options the initial default value is shown in brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
Note that options marked + affect only the state of new activities, and existing 
activities retain their original settings.
    </p>
    <h3>
Keyboard options
    </h3>
    <p>
        <em>
Auto-repeat rate (6):</em> determines the rate at which keys auto-repeat when held 
down continuously. Smaller values increase the repeat rate. A value of 0 gives 
no auto-repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Keyclick (No):</em> altering the option to <span class="screen">
            Yes</span> gives an audible bleep at each 
keypress, to provide additional feedback during touch-typing.
    </p>
    <p>
        + <em>Insert/Overtype (Insert):</em> in Insert mode text typed at the keyboard is inserted 
at the cursor position, and subsequent text on the line moves to the right to 
make space for the new text. Some typists prefer Overtype mode, in which 
text types over any text previously on the line. To insert text in Overtype 
mode you need to make a gap in the line with the <strong>Insert Character</strong> command 
<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />U first.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Filer options
    </h3>
    <p>
        + <em>Default device (:RAM.0):</em> the device to and from which files are saved and 
loaded, which is set to the internal RAM memory filing system by default. It 
can also be set to :RAM.1, :RAM.2, or :RAM.3, corresponding to the three 
RAM cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        + <em>Default directory:</em> allows a path of one or more directories, which should 
already exist, to be specified for all filing-system operations. By default the 
top-level directory is selected.
    </p>
    <h3>
Machine options
    </h3>
    <p>
        <em>
Timeout (mins) (5):</em> determines the time after which the Cambridge Z88 will 
switch off if nothing is typed at the keyboard; a value of 0 disables timeout. 
Setting the timeout to 2 minutes will extend the effective battery life of the 
Cambridge Z88 (1 minute is possible but not recommended for normal use).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Sound (Yes):</em> allows the internal sound system to be switched off.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Map (Yes):</em> allows the PipeDream page map display to be turned off if not 
required. Typing and editing will be marginally faster when the map is disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Map size (80):</em> allows the size of the map to be altered up to a maximum of 92 
characters across, or 255 characters across on an expanded machine. See <strong>
            Expanded/Unexpanded</strong>, p. 30.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Date format (European):</em> determines the format for all dates in the Cambridge 
Z88; the default date format is European, so that dates are recognised in the 
form:
    </p>
    <p>
day/month/year
    </p>
    <p>
The option can be changed to American to work with the format
    </p>
    <p>
month/day/year
    </p>
    <h3>
Serial port parameters
    </h3>
    <p>
        <em>
Transmit baud rate (9600) / Receive baud rate (9600):</em> can both be set to any of 
the following values:
    </p>
    <p>
75, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200, 38400
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Parity (None):</em> can be set to None, Space, Mark, Odd, or Even. The number of 
data bits is 8 if None is specified, or 7 otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
Xon/Xoff (Yes):</em> determines whether the serial communication protocol uses 
Xon/Xoff.
    </p>
    <p>
The number of start and stop bits is fixed as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
Transmit: 1 start bit, 2 stop bits. 
        <br />
Receive: 1 start bit, 1 stop bit.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> In versions of the Operating System up to and including 3.0 ODD and 
EVEN parity settings do not result in correct behaviour.
    </p>
    <h1>
Import/Export - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />X
    </h1>
    <p>
The Import/Export popdown enables you to transfer files between the 
Cambridge Z88 and other makes of computer. It communicates with the other 
computer through the serial port on the right-hand side of the machine. To use 
Import/Export you will need an Import/Export program for the other computer, 
and a connecting lead. Follow the directions supplied with this for a detailed 
explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
Details of the serial port connections are given in Appendix B.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Using Import/Export
    </h2>
    <p>
The serial parameters should be set up in the Panel before running 
Import/Export. Also run the communications software on the machine you wish 
to communicate with.
    </p>
    <p>
The program recognises the following commands, which are given by typing the 
first letter of the command:

with the cursor keys, and then press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key. Alternatively, pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />P 
or <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />B repeatedly will enter each PipeDream or BBC BASIC activity in turn.

    <h3>
Killing activities - <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL
    </h3>
    <p>
To kill a suspended activity, select it on the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES list with 
the cursor, and type <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />KILL. The activity will be removed from the list, and the 
document (or program) associated with it will be lost. <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PURGE is equivalent to 
a soft reset, which kills all suspended activities, and should therefore be used 
with great caution.
