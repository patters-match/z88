Section Three — Using the Diary
</h1>
    <p>
This chapter will show how you can use the Cambridge Z88 Diary application to 
organise your engagements, and plan your time. It demonstrates how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter engagements into the Diary</li>
        <li>Search for and list out all engagements relating a particular thing</li>
        <li>Use the Diary with the Calendar popdown to find any date very quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Entering the Diary
    </h2>
    <p>
Before using the Diary, make sure you have set the correct time and date on the 
Clock popdown, as described in Section One.
    </p>
    <p>
You can enter the Diary in either of two equivalent ways, whichever you find 
most convenient:
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Either:</em> go into the Index, by pressing the <span class="key">INDEX</span> key, and select the Diary from 
the APPLICATIONS list by pressing the <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" /> and <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> keys until the Diary item is 
highlighted. Then press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to enter it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Or</em>: type <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />D. You can do this from anywhere, even another application.
    </p>
    <p>
Once you have made entries in the Diary, it will appear on the list of 
SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES in the Index, but there can only be one copy of the 
Diary.
    </p>
    <p>
Type <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />CT to go to today's date, and the Diary screen display similar to the 
diagram shown below will appear:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/067.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
This gives you a page for today's date, onto which you can type information in 
any form you like. The information is stored permanently in the diary, and you 
will be able to refer back to it on another occasion.
    </p>
    <h2>
Making a Diary entry
    </h2>
    <p>
Try typing the following appointments onto today's page in the Diary, pressing 
the <span class="key">TAB</span> and <span class="key">ENTER</span> keys where indicated to lay out the lines neatly:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">Work:</span> <span class="key">TAB</span>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="type"">10.00 Sales
            meeting</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span>
        <br />
        <span class="type"">
Simon:</span> <span class="key">TAB</span>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="type"">12.30 Pick up from station</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span>
    </p>
    <p>
You can actually lay out information in the Diary however you like, but it is a 
good idea to label your appointments, as in the example above, because you will 
then be able to locate everything in a particular category by searching for the 
appropriate label. An example of this is given below.
    </p>
    <h2>
Moving between days
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can move between days in the Diary by typing
    </p>
    <p>
<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />	to go to the next day
    </p>
    <p>
<img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />		to go to the previous day
    </p>
    <p>
Try moving to the day after tomorrow, by typing <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" /><img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> twice. 
    </p>
    <p>
Then enter the following appointment:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">Work:</span> &nbsp; <span class="key">TAB</span>&nbsp;
        <span class="type"">11.00 Present report to Board</span>
        &nbsp; <span class="key">ENTER</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Searching for Diary entries
    </h2>
    <p>
The Diary provides a powerful <strong>Search</strong> command which enables you to find and 
list out all appointments in a particular category.
    </p>
    <p>
As an illustration, the following example provides a list of all appointments 
relating to Work.
    </p>
    <p>
        First select the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu, by pressing the <span class="key">MENU</span> key until <span class="screen"">BLOCKS</span>
        is 
highlighted on the menu bar at the left-hand side of the screen. Then move the 
cursor to highlight <strong>Search</strong> on the menu, and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the command.
    </p>
    <p>
The following prompts will be displayed:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">------------ STRING TO SEARCH FOR ---------&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
EQUATE UPPER AND LOWER CASE  ........... Yes<br />
SEARCH ONLY MARKED BLOCK	.............. No
            <br />
            PRODUCE LIST .......................... No<br />
PRINT LIST ............................ No </span>
    </p>
    <p>
Below the prompt <span class="screen"">STRING TO SEARCH
            FOR</span> type
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type"">Work:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
Then press <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" /> three times to move the cursor to the line 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">PRODUCE LIST .......................... No</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and type <span class="type"">Y</span> to alter
        the value of the option to <span class="screen"">Yes</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
Now press <span class="key">ENTER</span>, since the other options are not relevant, and the appointments 
will be listed:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
Thursday 17th March 1987 
            <br />
            Work: &nbsp; 10.00 Sales meeting </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">
Saturday 19th March 1987
            <br />
            Work: &nbsp; 11.00 Present report to board</span>
    </p>
    <p>
Of course, in your case the dates will be different, corresponding to the 
information you have used.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Using the Calendar and Diary together
    </h2>
    <p>
By calling the Calendar popdown from within the Diary, you can move quickly 
between different dates, and the Diary will then give the page for the date you 
have selected.
    </p>
    <p>
For example, having forgotten a friend's birthday on the 17th March, you decide 
to make an entry in the Diary to make sure you do not forget it the following 
year. Use the following procedure to find the right day very quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/070.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
You are now on the diary page for the same date one year later, and can type in 
the reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
Refer to the following section for a full list of the Calendar operations.
