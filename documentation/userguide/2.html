        Section Two - Using PipeDream
    </h1>
    <div>
        This section will familiarise you with all the essential facilities provided by
        PipeDream, through a series of three simple worked examples:
        <br />
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Design a party invitation, using PipeDream's text editing and page layout facilities.</li>
            <li>Set up a name and address list, using PipeDream's ability to organise information.</li>
            <li>Calculate home expenses, using PipeDream's facilities for working with tables of
                figures. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>
        Starting PipeDream</h1>
    <p>
        Before trying the sample applications using PipeDream, this section shows how to
        start PipeDream, and introduces the fundamental concepts necessary to an understanding
        of how to work with it.</p>
    <p>
        First start PipeDream with a blank document from the Index. To do this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are not already in the Index, press the <span class="key">INDEX</span> key.</li>
        <li>Select PipeDream from the Index APPLICATIONS list. Press
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
            to move into the APPLICATIONS list, if necessary, and press
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
            or
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
            until PipeDream is shown highlighted.</li>
        <li>Press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to enter PipeDream. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You will see the PipeDream opening screen, confirming that you have selected the
        PipeDream application.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/036.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        For clarity, the subsequent diagrams in this chapter show the central portion of
        the screen only.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Page display map
    </h3>
    <p>
        The page display map gives you an. overall view of the current page of the document
        you are working on in PipeDream. Each character in the document is represented by
        a single dot in the map, enabling you to see the layout of the whole page and, if
        necessary, to adjust the layout to improve the appearance.</p>
    <p>
        At any time the lines on the map corresponding to those displayed on the PipeDream
        screen are indicated by a vertical bar at the right-hand side of the map:</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/037.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        The structure of PipeDream</h2>
    <p>
        To make best use of PipeDream it is important to understand some basic principles
        of how PipeDream documents are constructed.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Rows and columns
    </h3>
    <p>
        Every document is divided into rows or lines, numbered 1, 2, 3... etc, and one or
        more columns, labelled with letters A, B, C... etc. Initially the document has 6
        columns, labelled A to F, each of which is 12 characters wide, but commands are
        available for you to alter the widths of individual columns or to alter the number
        of columns.
    </p>
    <p>
        The part of a document lying in one row and one column is called a slot. A slot
        is referred to by its column label and its row number; for example, the following
        diagram shows slot D3 highlighted by the highlighting bar:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/037_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The coordinates of the slot containing the cursor are shown at the top left of the
        PipeDream screen, and the column containing the cursor is identified by closely-
        spaced dots on the top border.
    </p>
    <p>
        The right-hand margin is indicated by the [Downicon] symbol on the top border, and
        normally all columns have their right-hand margins at the right-hand edge of the
        screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Much of the power and flexibility of PipeDream comes from the two different types
        of slot which you can create and combine within a single document: text slots and
        expression slots. Each type of slot can contain up to 240 characters.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Text slots
    </h3>
    <p>
        Text slots are used for entering and editing continuous text, such as the body of
        a letter, a technical paper, or a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
        When working with text, the columns in PipeDream behave as if they are on different
        layers, like separate overlapping sheets of paper. For example, the initial column
        format could be represented by the following diagram:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/038.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Text typed into column A behaves as if it is on the bottom layer, which is 72 characters
        wide; it will 'show through' the other layers, unless they contain text or expressions
        in the same row.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text typed into column F behaves as if it is on the uppermost layer, which is only
        12 characters wide.
    </p>
    <p>
        When text is typed into a text slot it will automatically wrap around to the start
        of the next row in the same column when the cursor reaches the right-hand margin
        for that column (unless wrapping has specifically been turned off).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Formatting
    </h3>
    <p>
        If justified text has been selected, from the Options Page, lines will be padded
        with spaces so that the right-hand margin is even. The layout of a document can
        be altered simply by moving the right-hand margin, and then reformatting the text
        paragraph by paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        By giving each column a different right-hand margin, independent columns of text
        can be created within the same document. With a little practice you will find that
        PipeDream is capable of creating quite complex multi-column page layouts.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Expression slots
    </h3>
    <p>
        Expression slots, on the other hand, are used for creating tables of figures or
        information, often called spreadsheets. These can contain mathematical expressions,
        including references to other slots in the document, and scientific functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main difference between expression slots and text slots is that once you have
        typed the expression into an expression slot, what is displayed in the document
        is not the expression itself, but the result of evaluating the expression. For example,
        if you typed 1.15 * 3 0 0 into an expression slot, the result 345 would be displayed
        in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        For spreadsheet work you can make all slots work as expression slots by default
        by setting the Options Page Text/Numbers setting to Numbers; see p. 136.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Mixing text and expressions</h3>
    <p>
        Text slots and expression slots can be mixed in the same document; so a letter could
        include a table of financial calculations automatically added together by PipeDream,
        or a company business plan could incorporate a spreadsheet within the descriptive
        text to show financial predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Values from expression slots can be included within formatted text in text slots
        using '@-fields'. This is convenient if, for example, you want a letter to refer
        to the result of a particular calculation.
    </p>
    <h3>
        The examples
    </h3>
    <p>
        The concepts of rows and columns, text slots and expression slots, and formatting
        text, are illustrated by the following three practical examples in the use of PipeDream.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Designing a party invitation</h1>
    <p>
        This chapter will explain how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type in text</li>
        <li>Make corrections to the text you have entered</li>
        <li>Create bold and underlined text</li>
        <li>Alter the layout of text</li>
        <li>Save the document</li>
        <li>Print the document</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Starting PipeDream
    </h2>
    <p>
        This example shows how PipeDream can be used in a typical word-processing application.
        To enter PipeDream from the Index starting with a blank document, select PipeDream
        from the Index, and press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Typing text
    </h2>
    <p>
        Type the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">You are invited to a beano.</span></p>
    <p>
        Notice that the cursor moves to the right as you type. The next character you type
        will always be typed at the position indicated by the cursor.
    </p>
    <p>
        A short time after you stop typing, you will see the page map, on the right-hand
        side of the screen, change to show the new layout of text on your page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/041.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Deleting
    </h2>
    <p>
        Press the <span class="key">DEL</span> key at the top right-hand side of the keyboard,
        until the word <span class="screen">beano</span> disappears.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="key">DEL</span> backspaces the cursor over the text you have typed,
        removing it from the page.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Word wrap
    </h2>
    <p>
        Type the word party and then continue to type the paragraph shown below. If you
        make a mistake, use the <span class="key">DEL</span> key to correct it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your typing reaches the right-hand margin, indicated by the symbol on the top
        border, just keep typing and PipeDream will automatically carry words over to the
        start of the next line.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">You are invited to a party to celebrate the creation of my first
            document with the Cambridge Z88 computer. Champagne will be provided.</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Adding text
    </h2>
    <p>
        PipeDream starts in Insert mode, although you also have the option of working in
        another mode called Overtype mode. You can change modes with the <strong>Insert/Overtype</strong>
        command; see p. 115.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Insert mode, text is always added at the position indicated by the cursor. You
        can add text simply by moving the cursor to the point where you want the text added,
        and then typing. The cursor is moved around on your document using the four arrow
        keys,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        at the bottom right-hand side of the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        Position the cursor after the word <span class="screen">champagne</span>, on the
        second line of the text you have just entered, press the space bar, and add the
        phrase:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">and smoked salmon</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The original text will move apart to make room for the new text, and words will
        wrap around to the next line at the right-hand margin to ensure that the altered
        text is correctly formatted.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/042.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Starting a new paragraph
    </h2>
    <p>
        After adding the new text press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key. <span class="key">
            ENTER</span> moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> twice more to leave a blank line and move the
        cursor down to row 5 on the page. Type the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">Sunday 28th February at 12 o'clock.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to end paragraphs, insert blank
        lines, and separate items in a list.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/042_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Columns
    </h2>
    <p>
        The page you are working on is divided into six columns, each 12 characters wide,
        shown by the rows of dots and the letters A to F on the top border of the screen.
        These provide the equivalent to tab positions on a typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the cursor still on row 5, press <span class="key">TAB</span> exactly five
        times. The cursor will move to the left-hand edge of each column in turn until it
        reaches the left-hand side of the column labelled 'F'. Notice that as the cursor
        moves into each blank slot, text overlapping the slot is hidden. Now type in the
        text:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">RSVP</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The text will be positioned near the right-hand side of the sheet, opposite the
        text already on row 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/043.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        You can move to the previous tab position by holding down the <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
        key and pressing <span class="key">TAB</span> Try doing this to move the cursor
        back into column A, at the left- hand side of the screen.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Replacing text
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can remove characters from the middle of a line by using the <strong>Delete Character</strong>
        command which you can give either using the <strong>EDIT</strong> menu, or by holding
        down the <span class="key">SHIFT</span> key and pressing <span class="key">DEL</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you decide to change the day of the party to Saturday 28th February. Move the
        cursor across to the <span class="screen">S</span> of <span class="screen">Sunday</span>
        with the cursor keys. Then, hold down the <span class="key">SHIFT</span> key and
        press <span class="key">DEL</span>; the [S] will be deleted. Keep pressing <span
            class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">DEL</span> until the word <span class="screen">
                Sunday</span> is removed. Then, type in the word Saturday to replace it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Inserting a line
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now add a heading to the invitation. To do this, you first need to insert two blank
        lines at the top of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the cursor up to the first line of your document, row 1, by pressing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now give the <strong>Insert Row</strong> command. You can do this either using the
        <strong>EDIT</strong> menu, or by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />N.
        A blank line will be added where the cursor was, and the remaining lines of the
        document will be moved down on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />N
        again to give two blank lines at the top of the page. Then type in the following
        text:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">A Once-in-a-lifetime Party</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/044.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The bottom line of your document will not be visible as it is off the bottom of
        the screen. You can make it scroll into view by moving the cursor down with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        key. Move the cursor back to the top line with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
        key before continuing with the example.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Adding styles to text
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can emphasise key phrases in your text by changing the style to bold, underlined
        or italics. This is achieved by selecting one of the highlight commands from the
        <strong>PRINT </strong>menu, or by typing one of the following highlight commands:</p>
    <p>
        <table id="Table1" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="500">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <strong>Command</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Effect</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Highlight code</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PU<br />
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PB<br />
                    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PI</td>
                <td>
                    for underlined text<br />
                    for bold text<br />
                    for italilc text</td>
                <td>
                    1<br />
                    2<br />
                    4</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Type the command once at the beginning of the text you want to emphasise, and give
        the same command at the end of the text you want to emphasise, to switch back to
        normal text.
    </p>
    <p>
        To emphasise the heading of the invitation, move the cursor to the beginning of
        the heading with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
        key. Then type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PB.
        A '2' symbol will be inserted before the text to indicate that a highlight code
        2 has been inserted. Move to the end of the heading with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />
        key, and type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />PB
        again. Another '2' symbol will be inserted. Now move the cursor down to the next
        line with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        key and the heading will be displayed bold on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you move the cursor onto the line containing highlights, the codes are displayed
        as highlighted numbers <span class="screen" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000">
            1</span> to <span class="screen" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #000000">8</span>
        so that you can edit them, or delete them, just like any other text characters.
        When you move the cursor onto another line, the effect of each highlight is shown
        on the screen, just as it will appear when printed out. (Italic text is displayed
        as tiny characters.)
    </p>
    <h2>
        Altering the layout of text
    </h2>
    <p>
        You can alter the layout of one or more lines of text in your document with one
        of the <strong>Align</strong> commands on the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu. For
        example, to centre a line of text, you move the cursor onto that line and then select
        the <strong>Centre Align</strong> command from the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu.
        Alternatively, you can type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />LAC.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the cursor onto the line containing the heading of the party invitation, if
        it is not there already, and type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />LAC.
        You will see the heading become centred on the page map (which always shows you
        the format of the page as it will appear when printed). The actual line of text
        will be centred on the document when you move the cursor onto the next line.

    <h2>
        Saving your document
    </h2>
    <p>
        Once you have finished working on a document it is a good idea to save it as a file
        to the Cambridge Z88 RAM. You will then be able to find it again without difficulty
        at a later date, and there is the added advantage that documents saved to the filing
        system take up less space and are more secure than documents left within PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can save a copy of your document into the Cambridge Z88 filing system by selecting
        <strong>Save</strong> from the <strong>FILES</strong> menu:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Press the <span class="key">MENU</span> key until the <strong>FILES</strong> menu
            is displayed on the screen.</li>
        <li>Press the
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
            key to highlight the <strong>Save</strong> command.</li>
        <li>Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to select the <strong>Save</strong> command.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The <strong>Save</strong> command optionally allows you to save only part of your
        document, and therefore prompts with the following questions:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to save
            <br />
            Save only range of columns No
            <br />
            Save selection of rows No
            <br />
            Save marked block No
            <br />
            Save plain text No </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Type in the name Invitation as the name of the file to be saved, so that the top
        prompt becomes
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to save Invitation</span></p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> since on this occasion you do not need
        to select any of the other options.
    </p>
    <p>
        A copy of the document will be saved with the name Invitation in the Cambridge Z88
        filing system. You will see the file <span class="screen">Invitation</span> listed
        if you select the Filer by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png" />F.
        Press <span class="key">ESC</span> to return to PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        If at some stage you expand the Cambridge Z88 with a RAM card, you can save a document
        to the extra RAM by referring to it in the file name as, for example:</p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">:RAM.1/Invitation</span>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Loading a document
    </h2>
    <p>
        Try loading back the document you have just saved using the PipeDream <strong>Load</strong>
        command.
    </p>
    <p>
        First clear the invitation from PipeDream by giving the <strong>New</strong> command
        from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu. If you have altered the document since you
        saved it, the prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Overwrite text?</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        will be displayed at the top of the display, to give you the chance to go back and
        save your changes. Press <span class="type">Y</span> to clear the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then select the <strong>Load</strong> command from the <strong>FILES</strong> menu.
        As in the case of the <strong>Save</strong> command, fill in the file name in the
        list of options</p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Name of file to load Invitation</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to load the file. You should see the invitation
        exactly as you saved it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Printing the document
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you have a printer connected to the Cambridge Z88, you can print out a copy of
        the invitation with the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the <strong>PRINT</strong> menu by pressing the <span class="key">TAB</span>
            key until <strong>PRINT</strong> is highlighted on the Menu List.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Print</strong> operation may already be highlighted as it is the first
            item on the menu; otherwise use the cursor keys to select it.</li>
        <li>Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the <strong>Print</strong> command.</li>
        <li>Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> again to ignore the <strong>Print</strong>
            options and print the invitation. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can repeat the procedure to print as many copies as you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/047.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        To get bold and underlined text to print correctly you may need to use the Printer
        Editor; see <strong>Section Nine - The Printer Editor</strong>, P. 181.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What next?
    </h2>
    <p>
        You have just seen how the Cambridge Z88 makes it a simple matter to write text,
        correct mistakes, alter the layout, and print a document.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cambridge Z88 also enables you to compile a catalogue of information, as demonstrated
        in the next worked example.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Compiling a name and address list
    </h1>
    <p>
        This example shows how you can enter any type of information such as a library catalogue,
        a book index or bibliography, or a name and address list into the Cambridge Z88
        using PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter information</li>
        <li>Find any particular information you want</li>
        <li>Organise the information</li>
        <li>Print out all, or a selection, of the information in an orderly table</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Preparing the document
    </h2>
    <p>
        Because you are going to enter lists of information, rather than a block of text
        for formatting into a document, you should first alter the <em>Wrap</em> option
        on the <strong>Options Page</strong> so that words do not wrap around onto the next
        line when they reach the right-hand margin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the <strong>Options Page</strong> by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />O.
        You will see a display showing the different options you can select for your document,
        and information about the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the cursor down to the wrap option by pressing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        until the cursor is opposite the word <span class="screen">Wrap</span>. Then type
        <span class="type">N</span> to change the option value from <span class="screen">Y</span>
        (Yes) to <span class="screen">N</span> (No) to stop wrapping altogether:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/049.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Finally press the <span class="key">ESC</span> key to return to the document.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Setting up headings
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before entering information into PipeDream, it is good practice to set up headings
        to specify how the information will be arranged. Since you are going to create a
        name and address list, the headings will simply correspond to the name and address,
        with one reserved for additional information.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you start a new sheet in PipeDream you are given six columns, each 12 characters
        wide. Although you can enter lines of text much wider than this in each column,
        it will make working with the name and address information simpler if, at this point,
        you make each of the columns in the document wider. You do this with the <strong>Width</strong>
        command in the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the <span class="key">MENU</span> key until the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu
        is displayed. The <strong>Width</strong> command may already be highlighted as it
        is the first item on the menu; otherwise use the cursor keys to highlight it. Then
        press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to select it. In reply to the prompt</p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">New width</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        type
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">24</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to carry out the change. (You can ignore
        the other prompt - <span class="screen">Specify column</span>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The width of the column containing the cursor, column A, will increase to 24 characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now move the cursor into column B by pressing the <span class="key">TAB</span> key,
        and repeat the procedure to set the width of column B to 24 also. You can, if you
        wish, select the Width command directly without going through the <strong>LAYOUT</strong>
        menu, by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />W.
    </p>
    <p>
        Continue until you have set each of the columns A to F to a width of 24 characters.
        Notice that when you press the <span class="key">TAB</span> key to get from column
        C to column D, the document moves to the left on the screen so that columns D and
        E come into view without the cursor position changing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then move the cursor back to the left-hand side of column A by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><span
            class="key">TAB</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Type the following headings, pressing the <span class="key">TAB</span> key between
        each heading to move the cursor to the beginning of the next column.
    </p>
    <p>
        Name <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        Address<span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        Town <span class="key">TAB<br />
        </span>County <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        Postcode <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        Info
    </p>
    <p>
        Notice that when you type the word <span class="type">Town</span> and press the
        <span class="key">TAB</span> key, the document scrolls to the left so that the column
        headed 'D' comes clearly into view:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/051.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        So, although you can only see three of the six columns in your document at any one
        time, it is a simple matter to move about and find the information you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although it should be quite obvious what you will be using each of the first five
        headings for, you may be wondering what the purpose of the last heading <span class="screen">
            Info</span> might be. You can use this to record additional information about
        all of the people in your address list, such as whether you sent them a Christmas
        card last year, when their birthday is, or any other information you would like
        to be able to recall. In the following examples the field will contain the person's
        age.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Entering some information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Move the cursor back to the left-hand side of column A by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><span
            class="key">TAB</span>. Press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to move
        the cursor to row 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can now type the first name into slot A2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">Bell , A</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the <span class="key">TAB</span> key when you have finished typing the name
        to move the cursor across to the address column, column B. Type in the address,
        remembering to press the <span class="key">TAB</span> key between each item:
    </p>
    <p>
        Bell , A <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        2 Ringway <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        Tring<span class="key">TAB</span>

        <br />
        TE1 2LM <span class="key">TAB</span>
        <br />
        24
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/052.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Enter the other names and addresses given below on lines 3, 4, 5, and 6 of your
        document in exactly the same way. Of course, if you prefer, you can compile your
        own list. If part of an address is too long to fit within one column, just keep
        typing; although you will not be able to see all the information in that column,
        it will be retained and you will be able to refer to it later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, be sure to keep to the headings at the top of the document. For example, if
        a particular address does not have anything corresponding to a county, leave that
        column blank so that you put the postcode under the correct heading. This will enable
        you to search for a particular postcode, as described later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complete the table as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">

    <h2>
        Saving the document
    </h2>
    <p>
        Since by now you may have spent some time entering information into your document,
        it is a good idea to save a copy to the Cambridge Z88 filing system in case you
        accidentally lose the information during the next experiments. You save a copy of
        the document by using the same procedure as the one used for the party invitation.
    </p>
    Select the <strong>Save</strong> command by pressing the <span class="key">MENU</span>
    key until the <strong>FILES</strong> menu is displayed. Press the
    <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
    key to highlight <strong>Save</strong>. Then press <span class="key">ENTER</span>
    to give the <strong>Save</strong> command.
    <p>
        Type <span class="type">addresses</span> as the name of file to save, ignoring the
        other options since you want to save the whole document, and press <span class="key">
            ENTER</span>. A copy of the document will now be saved to the filing system.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sorting the information
    </h2>
    <p>
        Now that you have entered a table of names and addresses, it would be useful to
        have them sorted into alphabetical order so that you can look up a particular name
        more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        First you need to specify which part of your document you want to sort. Move the
        cursor to slot A2, the top left-hand comer of the table of names and addresses,
        using the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
        and
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        keys to move up and down the document and the <span class="key">TAB</span> and <span
            class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">TAB</span> commands to move across
        the document between columns to the left and right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mark slot A2 by giving the <strong>Mark Block</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong>
        menu, or by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Z.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you give the command, slot A2 will be highlighted on the screen to indicate
        that it has been marked:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/053.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Now mark the bottom right-hand corner of the table of names and addresses. Move
        the cursor down to row 6 and across to column F with the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        key and the <span class="key">TAB</span> command. Then give the <strong>Mark Block</strong>
        command again. When you have completed the second <strong>Mark Block</strong> command,
        the entire table of names and addresses will be selected and shown highlighted on
        the screen.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/053_2.png" height="0" width="0" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The highlighted table of slots is referred to as a 'block', and several commands
        are available which will operate on an entire block of slots that you have selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move back to the left-hand side of the sheet with
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><span
            class="key">TAB</span> .
    </p>
    <p>
        To sort the block of slots, use the <strong>Sort</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong>
        menu. Press the <span class="key">MENU</span> key until the <strong>BLOCKS</strong>
        menu is displayed. Then press the
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        key until the <strong>Sort</strong> command is highlighted on the menu, and press
        <span class="key">ENTER</span> to select the command.
    </p>
    <p>
        We wish to sort the names and addresses into alphabetical order of the names, which
        are in column A, so type A to the prompt
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Sort on column A</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to perform the sort. (You can ignore
        the other prompts for the moment.)
    </p>
    <p>
        You will see that the names and addresses have been correctly sorted within the
        table. You can clear the marked block by giving the <strong>Clear Mark</strong>
        command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu, or by pressing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Q:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/054.png" height="0" width="0" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        You could, of course, have sorted the information on a different heading by specifying
        another column, rather than column A, when you gave the <strong>Sort</strong> command.
        For example, you may like to experiment with sorting the same names and addresses
        on the Town column, or on the column containing the peoples' ages.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Finding information
    </h2>
    <p>
        You could have entered many more names and addresses than the few you have already
        stored without running out of space in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see how much space is available in a document at any time by typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />O
        to display the Options Page. The number of characters of space available is given
        after the heading <span class="screen">Free</span> on the right-hand side of the
        Options Page display. Press <span class="key">ESC</span> return to your document.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a large list of names and addresses, it would be very inconvenient to have to
        search around in the list for a particular name or address. Fortunately, there is
        a much faster way, using the automatic search facility built into PipeDream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the <strong>Search</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu
        in the usual way: display the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu with the <span class="key">
            MENU</span> key, and use the cursor keys to highlight <strong>Search</strong>;
        then press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the <strong>Search</strong> command.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Search</strong> command displays a number of options which allow you
        to specify exactly what you want to search for, and whether you want to restrict
        the search to a particular part of your table of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you might want to search for the address of someone whose surname you
        had forgotten, but whose Christian name you knew to be Max. You would then enter
        <span class="type">Max</span> against the first option:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">String to search for Max</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        to move to the next option which initially shows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Search only range of columns No</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="type">Y</span> to alter the option value to <span class="screen">
            Yes</span>, and type <span class="type">A</span>, to specify that you want to
        search only column A, which contains the names. The option will now read:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Search only range of columns Yes A</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to begin the search. The cursor will instantly
        find the name <span class="screen">Hill, Max</span>, allowing you to read off his
        address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Incidentally, if the name you chose to search for found someone else with the same
        name first, you could use the <strong>Next Match</strong> command on the <strong>BLOCKS</strong>
        Menu to move on and find the next item that contained the same name.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Help with searching
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is a peculiarity of the way we remember information that we can often only remember
        part of what we are trying to recall. For example, we may know that the person we
        are trying to find lives in a town called something like Caxton — or perhaps it
        was Croxton? Or then again, perhaps it was Foxton. The PipeDream <strong>Search</strong>
        command has two facilities which help in just this type of situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can type the symbols ^# in the string you are looking for, to represent any
        combination of letters (including none). Thus, you simply have to specify
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">String to search for ^#xton</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        to find any of the towns, Caxton, Croxton or Foxton, or any other town ending in
        'xton'.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also specify the symbols ^? which will match any single letter or character
        in the string you are searching for. So, if you could only remember that the name
        of a road had three letters, you could search for</p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">^?^?^? Road</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and you would be sure to find it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Printing information
    </h2>
    <p>
        To print out the information in your name and address list as an orderly table,
        select the <strong>Print</strong> option from the <strong>PRINT</strong> menu. Press
        the <span class="key">MENU</span> key until the <strong>PRINT</strong> menu is displayed.
        Select <strong>Print</strong> using the cursor keys, and then press <span class="key">
            ENTER</span> to give the command.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the total width of the table of names and addresses is 144 characters (six
        columns of 24 characters) it will probably be too wide to fit across the width of
        the paper on your printer; most printers will only print 80 characters. You will
        therefore need to print the table in two sections, by selecting a range of columns
        in each case.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first time you give the <strong>Print</strong> command, alter the option
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Print only range of Columns No </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        to <span class="screen">Yes</span> by typing <span class="type">Y</span>, followed
        by <span class="typee">A C</span> so that the option reads
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Print only range of columns Yes A C </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Then press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to start printing. Once this is
        finished, give the <strong>Print</strong> command again, this time specifying the
        option as
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Print only range of columns Yes D F </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, some printers will print up to 132 characters across; in this case
        you may be able to fit the whole table onto a single sheet of paper by first reducing
        the width of some of the columns using the <strong>Width</strong> command on the
        <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Printing selected rows
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you were going to use the name and address list for a business mail shot, you
        might want to compile a selective list containing only the names and addresses of
        people living in one particular area. The PipeDream <strong>Print</strong> command
        caters for this by allowing you to specify a test to be performed on each row of
        the document. Only those rows for which the test succeeds will be printed.
    </p>
    <p>
        You specify the test in terms of slots in row 1; PipeDream automatically alters
        the slot coordinates to refer to the appropriate row as testing proceeds through
        the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, to print out the names and addresses of all the people living in Hants
        or Surrey, give the <strong>Print</strong> command in the usual way by displaying
        the <strong>PRINT</strong> menu and then pressing <span class="key">ENTER</span>
        to give the <strong>Print</strong> command. Then move the cursor to the option
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Select rows to print No</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Change the option value to <span class="screen">Yes</span>, by typing <span class="type">
            Y</span>, and type in the selection expression
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">D1="Hants" | Dl="Surrey" </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The '|' symbol means 'OR', so the whole expression means: "If the item in slot D1
        is Hants or the item in slot D1 is Surrey...". In row 2 the test will apply to D2,
        and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The selection expression can be virtually as complicated as you need, and can include
        tests on several different columns. For example, for a mail shot of information
        on a new wonder hair tonic you might want to select all men over 30 on the name
        and address list. The expression might be
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">Dl="London" & G1="M" &amp; F1&gt;=30</span></p>
    <p>
        where G1 was an extra column containing M or F to indicate the sex. The '&amp;'
        symbol means 'AND' and can be used to link several tests together.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Calculating home expenses
    </h1>
    <p>
        The next worked example shows how to use the Cambridge Z88 to perform numerical
        calculations. It shows how you would analyse your monthly expenses, and discover
        what proportion of your income you were spending on each.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will learn how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter numbers and expressions into a table</li>
        <li>Copy expressions to save typing</li>
        <li>Perform calculations</li>
        <li>Alter the format of the numbers </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Designing the table
    </h2>
    <p>
        You are going to create a table which shows for each of the months January to May
        what your expenditure has been on your mortgage, food, car, gas and electricity,
        and telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
        At first sight it might appear that an awful lot of typing would be involved in
        setting up such a table. However, as you will see, all the repetition is carried
        out automatically for you by PipeDream and very little typing is actually needed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Moving around the document
    </h2>
    <p>
        To set up the table of expenses you will need to be familiar with the procedure
        for moving the cursor between slots (or columns) in the document. Remember that
        you will need to use the following keys:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
        to move up a line
        <br />
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        to move down a line
        <br />
        <span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">TAB</span> to move to the previous
        slot to the left
        <br />
        <span class="key">TAB</span> to move to the next slot to the right
        <br />
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" /><span
            class="key">TAB</span> to move to the leftmost slot
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, when you are at the left-hand edge of- a slot, pressing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />
        will move to the previous slot to the left, if there is one.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you are working with a document you can use the <strong>First Column</strong>,
        <strong>Last Column</strong>, <strong>Top of Column</strong>, or <strong>Bottom of Column</strong>
        commands on the <strong>CURSOR</strong> menu to move to the four edges of the document
        in a single operation.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Labelling the table
    </h2>
    <p>
        You are now going to set up the column and row labels for the table of expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move the cursor to slot B1 and type the label <span class="type">Jan</span> (for
        January). Likewise type <span class="type">Feb</span>, <span class="type">March</span>,
        and <span class="type">April</span> in slots C1 to E1 to complete the column headings
        for the table. Later you could extend the table for a whole year's figures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now type the row labels for the different expense categories, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        In slot: Enter:
        <br />
        A2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="type">Rates</span>
        <br />
        A3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="type">Mortgage</span>
        <br />
        A4 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="type">Food</span>
        <br />
        A5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="type">Car</span>
        <br />
        A6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="type">Gas/Elect</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The table headings are now complete. Move the cursor back up to slot B2, and the
        table should appear as shown on the following screen:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/059.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Entering the rates
    </h2>
    <p>
        The rates in the example are going to be £500 per half-year. This is going to be
        divided evenly over each month's expenses, but you do not need to divide 500 by
        6; PipeDream will do it for you. You only have to enter the expression <span class="type">
            500/6</span> into slot B2 (the '/' sign means divide).
    </p>
    <p>
        However, you first need to specify that this slot is to be an expression slot, so
        that whatever you type into it will be evaluated, and so that other slots on the
        table can refer to the result. To do this you give the <strong>Edit Expression</strong>
        command from the <strong>EDIT</strong> menu; alternatively you may find it more
        convenient to type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X
        which has the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The slot B2 will be highlighted on the screen to show that you are editing an expression
        slot, and the cursor will move to the centre of the top line of the screen so that
        you can enter an expression. Type the expression
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">500/6</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key to enter it into slot B2. The number
        83.33 will be displayed right-aligned in slot B2.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Referring to slots
    </h2>
    <p>
        You do not need to type the rates expression into the other slots in row 2; you
        can simply indicate that you want the same value as slot B2 by typing the coordinates
        of that slot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move to slot C2 and press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X
        to enter an expression. Then type
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">B2</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        and press <span class="key">ENTER</span>. The value 83.33 will appear in slot C2.
        Likewise enter the expression <span class="type">B2</span> into slots D2 and E2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Effectively you have specified that you always want slots C2 to E2 to contain the
        same value as slot B2. So, for example, suppose you were granted a rates reduction
        to £400 per half-year. Move the cursor back to slot B2 and type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X
        to display the slot's previous contents, 500/6. Delete them, by typing
    </p>
    <p>
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />D
    </p>
    <p>
        and then type the new value:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">400/6</span> <span class="key">ENTER</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only will the value in B2 change to 66.67, but slots C2 to E2 will also change,
        since they refer to this value.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Replicating values
    </h2>
    <p>
        Next you are going to enter the figure 200 for the four months' mortgage payments.
        Type <span class="type">200</span> into slot B3. If you forgot to type
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X
        when entering the figure, the number will appear left-aligned just as you entered
        it. In this case, move the cursor back to the slot and press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X
        and then <span class="key">ENTER</span> afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to type the same value in slots C3 to E3; the <strong>Replicate</strong>
        command will do it automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the <strong>Replicate</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu,
        and press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to execute it. Answer the prompts as follows,
        pressing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />
        to move to the next line after entering B3:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Range to copy from B3
            <br />
            Range to copy to C3 E3</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        This says that you are going to replicate the value in slot B3 to the range of slots
        C3 to E3. Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to give the command, and the figure
        <span class="screen">200.00</span> should appear across the entire row so that the
        table appears as shown:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/061.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Note that until you press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key you can alter the
        values you have typed for the ranges, moving between the two prompts with
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png" />
        and
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png" />.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Other expenses
    </h2>
    <p>
        The expenses in the other categories will tend to vary each month. You can either
        type in the figures used in the example shown below, or use figures from your own
        experience. In either case complete the table, remembering to make each slot into
        an expression slot before you enter the figure, or if you forget, afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/061_2.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Monthly totals
    </h2>
    <p>
        You are now going to produce monthly totals for the expenses. Enter the label <span
            class="type">TOTAL</span> into slot A7, and press <span class="key">TAB</span>
        to move the cursor to slot B7.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X,
        and enter the following expression:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B2 B6)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press the <span class="key">ENTER</span> key, and PipeDream will perform the calculation
        and instantly display the sum of the figures in the range of slots B2 to B6; ie
        all the expenses for January.
    </p>
    <p>
        The function <span class="type">sum(B2 B6)</span> is a convenient way of writing
        the equivalent expression
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">B2+B3+B4+B5+B6 </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        where the slots to be added are all in a row, column, or rectangular table.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Replicating slot references
    </h2>
    <p>
        Just as you replicated the value 200.00 above, you can also replicate an expression
        across a range of slots. Where the expression contains references to other slots,
        as in this example <span class="type">sum(B2 B6)</span>, the references will automatically
        be altered to reflect the change in position.
    </p>
    <p>
        Replicate the expression you have just entered for slot B7 to slots C7 to E7 as
        follows. Select the <strong>Replicate</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong>
        menu, and give the options as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Range to copy from B7
            <br />
            Range to copy to C7 E7</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> and totals will appear for each column. The
        <strong>Replicate</strong> command has automatically altered the range B2B6 to give
        the appropriate totals in columns C to E.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you now move the cursor to slot C7 you will see the expression in that slot displayed
        at the top left-hand side of the screen:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">sum(C2C6)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that PipeDream removes unnecessary spaces when storing an expression.

    <h2>
        Percentage expenditures
    </h2>
    <p>
        As a final illustration of the power of PipeDream in analysing figures, you are
        going to calculate the percentage expenditure represented by each of the categories
        in the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        First type the label
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">Percentage </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        in slot Fl.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next find the total expenditure for the four months in the table. Move to slot F7,
        press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />X,
        and enter the expression
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B7 E7)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead of typing the references B7 and E7, you can 'point to' each slot by moving
        the highlighted slot with the keys <span class="key">TAB</span>, <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
        <span class="key">TAB</span>,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png" />, and
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png" />,
        and then give the <strong>Insert Reference</strong> command,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />K,
        to enter the corresponding references, B7 and then E7, into the editing line.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now move to F2 and enter the following expression (which will be explained in a
        moment):
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B2 E2)/$F$7 * 100</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> to enter the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        This expression is built up as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B2 E2)</span> is the total spent on rates for the four months.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">F7</span> is the overall total expenditure for the four months.
        The $ signs 'freeze' the reference so that when the expression is replicated, the
        reference to F7 will remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B2 E2)/$F$7</span> is thus the proportion of the overall
        expenditure spent on rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="type">sum(B2 E2)/$F$7 * 100</span> expresses this proportion as a percentage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now replicate this expression down the remaining slots in column F by giving the
        <strong>Replicate</strong> command from the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu, and entering
        the options as
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Range to copy from F2
            <br />
            Range to copy to F3 F6</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        The appropriate percentages will be displayed against each category.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/064.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        Changing the format
    </h2>
    <p>
        When you first start using PipeDream, the results of all expression slots are displayed
        with two decimal places, the most useful format for working with financial calculations
        (although values are stored internally with full accuracy).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can alter the display format for all expression slots in your document by changing
        the <em>Decimal Places</em> option on the <strong>Options Page</strong> menu, or
        for individual slots with the <strong>Decimal Places</strong> command on the <strong>
            LAYOUT</strong> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the table would look tidier if the percentages were displayed with
        no decimal places. First, mark the block of slots containing the percentages with
        the following procedure:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Move the cursor to F2 and give the <strong>Mark Block</strong> command on the <strong>
            BLOCKS</strong> menu; alternatively, type
            <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Z
            as shown on the list of key functions above the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Move the cursor to F6 and give the <strong>Mark Block</strong> command again. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The block containing slots F2 to F6 will now be highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now select the <strong>Decimal Places</strong> command from the <strong>LAYOUT</strong>
        menu. Reply to the prompts as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="screen">Number of decimal places 0
            <br />
            Floating format No </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Press <span class="key">ENTER</span> and the numbers will be displayed with no decimal
        places.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also specify that certain characters, given on the <strong>Options Page</strong>,
        should be displayed before or after certain numbers in the document. By default,
        the trailing characters are set to '%', and the leading characters are set to '£'.
    </p>
    <p>
        To display a '%' sign after the numbers in the marked block, give the <strong>Trailing
            Characters </strong>command from the <strong>LAYOUT </strong>menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also display a '£' sign before each value in the table. Mark the block of
        slots from B2 to E7 by moving the cursor to each of these slots in turn and typing
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Z.
        Then give the Leading Characters command from the LAYOUT menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the column labels can be right-aligned. Mark slots B1 to F1 with the <strong>
            Mark Block </strong>command,
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Z,
        and give the <strong>Right Align </strong>command from the <strong>LAYOUT </strong>
        menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press
        <img style="vertical-align: middle" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png" />Q
        to clear the marked area, and the table will now appear as shown:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/065.png" />&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        What you have learnt
    </h2>
    <p>
        These three examples have demonstrated how PipeDream can help you to write letters
        and design text documents (word processing), set up lists of information, sort them,
        retrieve the items you need (databases), and set up and perform calculations on
        tables of numerical or financial information (spreadsheets).
    </p>
    <p>
        For simplicity, each example focussed on one aspect of PipeDream's capabilities.
        However, the real power of PipeDream comes in its ability to mix all three different
        functions in a single document. For example, the expense account could be incorporated
        into a letter to your bank manager, the name and address list could include financial
        information and calculations, or the party invitation could be automatically addressed
        to everyone on your name and address list.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are now in a position to start using PipeDream for your own applications, but
        to get the most out of its facilities you will probably want to read through the
        list of commands given in Section Five. You will then be able to refer back to it
        when your requirements of PipeDream become more advanced.
