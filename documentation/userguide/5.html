<h1>Section Five - PipeDream reference</h1>
<p>This section describes all of the PipeDream commands that are
available
in each menu. To understand this chapter, you should already be
familiar with the basic concepts of using PipeDream described in
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section Two - Using
PipeDream</span>.</p>
<p>All commands can be typed directly from the keyboard, as well
as chosen
from the appropriate menu. The keyboard equivalent for each command is
shown to the right of the command name in the menu. For example, the <strong>Replicate</strong>
command on the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu appears as</p>
<p><span class="screen">Replicate </span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><span class="screen">BRE</span></p>
<p>This means that you can give the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Replicate</span> command by
typing
the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> key
followed by the keys <span class="type">B R E</span>.
Note that the letters do not need to be in
capitals:&nbsp;<img class="type" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><span class="type">
b r e</span> has the same effect. Also, you can hold down
the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
key while typing the letter keys if you prefer.</p>
<p>When, as in this example, the command equivalent is a sequence
of two
or three letters, the first letter will usually be the first letter of
the menu name. For frequently-used commands, the key equivalent is a
single letter with the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> key (in
a very few cases the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"> key). For
example, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mark Block</span>
command on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BLOCKS</span>
menu has the equivalent <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">Z.</p>
<p>Note that in the following screen diagrams the highlighting
bar has
been omitted for clarity.</p>
<h2>Setting the options</h2>
<p>Some commands present you with a table of options which allow
you to
set up the command to your requirements.</p>
<p>To begin with, the cursor is positioned next to the first
option; the
cursor keys can be' used as normal to move up and down the list.</p>
<p>Many of the options have only two possible alternatives: <span class="screen">Yes</span>
and <span class="screen">No</span>.
You can change the value shown either by typing <span class="type">Y</span>
or <span class="type">N</span> as appropriate,
or by using the <strong>Next Option</strong>
command,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">J, which
alternates between
the
available values. In the case of options which take specific values,
such as <strong>Page Length</strong>, <strong>Next
Option</strong> restores the default value.</p>
<h1><a id="Operations on blocks of slots - BLOCKS">Operations
on blocks of slots - BLOCKS</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 79px;" alt="" src="images/102.png"></p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu
enable you to manipulate
documents to
control exactly which areas are affected by a particular operation. A
block can include anything from a single slot to a complete document.</p>
<h2>Marking</h2>
<p>Before giving any block command you identify the slots you
wish to
operate on using the <strong>Mark Block</strong> command.
You can mark a single slot, a
row of slots, a column of slots, or a rectangular block of slots
spanning several rows and columns.</p>
<p>You identify which block of slots you want to operate on by
giving the
<strong>Mark Block</strong> command at the top left-hand
corner and bottom right-hand
corner of the block. After giving the two <strong>Mark Block</strong>
commands, all the
selected slots in the block will be shown highlighted on the screen.</p>
<h3>Mark Block -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">Z</h3>
<p>Marks a single slot, or the top left-hand corner and bottom
right-hand
corner of a rectangular block of slots, to identify the slots to be
operated on by subsequent block commands.</p>
<h3>Clear Marks -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">Q</h3>
<p>Clears any marked block previously set up with the <strong>Mark
Block</strong>
command.</p>
<h2>Replicating slots</h2>
<h3>Replicate -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BRE</h3>
<p>Reproduces the contents of a slot, or block of slots, in any
part of
the document. The following options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Range to copy from</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Range to copy to</span></p>
<p>Each range is a block of slots identified by specifying the
coordinates
of its top left-hand corner and bottom right-hand corner. If necessary,
extra rows and/or columns are created in the document to accommodate
the new slots.</p>
<p>The ranges can be one of the following forms:</p>
<p><strong>1. Single slot
to area</strong></p>
<p><em>Range to copy from</em>: a single slot, eg A1.<br>
<em>Range to copy to</em>: an area, eg B3 D7, or just a row
or column range. The
area can include the original slot, if required.</p>
<p>The contents of the slot are copied over the entire area, as
represented symbolically in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img style="width: 439px; height: 211px;" alt="" src="images/103.png"></p>
<p><strong>2. Column to area</strong></p>
<p><em>Range to copy from</em>: a column array, eg A1
A3.<br>
<em>Range to copy to</em>: a single slot or a row array, eg
B5 D5.</p>
<p>The column is copied to the target column starting at either
the single
slot, or the range of slots given by the target row.</p>
<p><img style="width: 441px; height: 208px;" alt="" src="images/104.png"></p>
<p><strong>3. Row to area</strong></p>
<p><em>Range to copy from</em>: a row array, eg A1C1.<br>
<em>Range to copy to</em>: a single slot or a column array,
eg B5 B7.</p>
<p>The row is copied to the target row, starting either at the
single slot
or at the range of slots given by the target column, as shown on the
following page:</p>
<p><img style="width: 443px; height: 208px;" alt="" src="images/104_2.png"></p>
<p><strong>4. Area to area</strong></p>
<p><em>Range to copy from</em>: an area, eg A1 B2.<br>
<em>Range to copy to</em>: a single slot,
eg C5.</p>
<p>The area is copied to the area with the top left-hand corner
defined by
the single slot.</p>
<p><img style="width: 441px; height: 207px;" alt="" src="images/105.png"></p>
<p>If the slots contain slot references, the references are
updated to
take account of their altered position, unless they are fixed with the
$ operator.</p>
<h2>Copy, Move, and Delete</h2>
<h3>Copy -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BC</h3>
<p>Copies a marked block of slots to the position in the document
indicated by the cursor. Slots in the document will be moved apart to
make space for the block being copied, in contrast with the <strong>Replicate</strong>
command which overwrites the target area.</p>
<p>Slot references in the new block are updated as for the
<strong>Replicate</strong>
command, but references to slots within the block are not altered.</p>
<h3>Move -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BM</h3>
<p>Moves a marked block of slots from its original position to
the
position indicated by the cursor. All slot references are updated as
appropriate.</p>
<p>Note that if you attempt to move a block of slots to a new
position
which overlaps the same rows or columns as the original block, the
error</p>
<p><span class="screen">Overlap</span></p>
<p>will be displayed.</p>
<h3>Delete -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BD</h3>
<p>Deletes a marked block of slots from the document. Since you
will lose
the information previously in those slots, it is a good idea to save a
copy of your document before deleting a large area, so that you can
revert to this if you accidentally delete valuable information.</p>
<h2>Sorting</h2>
<h3>Sort -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BSO</h3>
<p>Sorts a marked block of slots. Text slots are sorted into
alphabetical
order, expression slots into numeric order, and date slots into date
order. The following options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Sort on column</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Sort in reverse order &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Don't update references
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sort on column</em>: set to a column label (A,
B, C etc) to specify
which
column within the marked block should be used to determine the ordering
of the slots.</p>
<p><em>Sort in reverse order</em>: by default, the
marked block is sorted
into
ascending order, and any slot references are updated as appropriate.
Setting this option to <span class="screen">Yes</span>
will sort the specified column in
descending order.</p>
<p><em>Don't update references</em>: setting this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> inhibits
the
updating of slot references within the block being sorted. This gives a
faster sort operation, and can be used provided no slots within the
sorted block are referred to either from within or from outside the
sorted block.</p>
<h2>Searching and replacing</h2>
<h3>Search -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BSE</h3>
<p>Search is for a specified string within a single document, or
a
multi-file document. The following options are available:</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search only range of columns
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Equate upper and lower case
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search only
marked block &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search from current file &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search all files in list &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The string to be searched for is specified in the same way as
for the
<strong>Replace</strong> command, and the equivalent
options have the same effect; see
below.</p>
<p>When the search is completed, a message such as</p>
<p><span class="screen">27 found</span></p>
<p>will be displayed where 27 is the number of matches since the
last
<strong>Search</strong> command.</p>
<h3>Next Match -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BNM</h3>
<p>Following a <strong>Search</strong> command, the <strong>Next
match</strong> command can be used
to find
the next occurrence of the specified string starting at the current
cursor position.</p>
<h3>Replace - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BRP</h3>
<p>Searches for and replaces occurrences of one specified string
by
another. The following options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search only range of columns
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Equate upper and lower case
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Ask for
confirmation &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search only marked block &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Search all files in list &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span></p>
<p>By default, the <strong>Replace</strong> command
replaces all occurrences of
the first
specified string with the second specified string throughout the
current document, equating upper- and lower-case letters and prompting
for confirmation before each replacement. For example</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;Cat</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dog</span></p>
<p>will replace Cat with Dog, cat with dog, and CAT with
DOG.</p>
<p>On each
occurrence of the search string, the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Replace: N, Y?</span></p>
<p>will be displayed at the top of the screen. Answer <span class="type">Y</span> to
perform the
replacement, <span class="type">N</span> to proceed
to the next occurrence of the search string,
or press the <span class="key">ESC</span> key to
cancel the command. When the command is
completed, the message</p>
<p><span class="screen">27 found</span></p>
<p>(or as appropriate) will be displayed to show the total number
of
replacements that have been made.</p>
<p><em>String to search for</em>: specifies the
search string, which can
be up to
240 characters in length.</p>
<p>Certain special sequences of characters can be used in the
search
string to represent characters which cannot be typed at the keyboard,
or classes of search string:</p>
<table class="frames">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sequence</strong></td>
<td><strong>Matches</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^1..^8<br>
^^<br>
^?<br>
^#<br>
^S<br>
^Rref<br>
^R#<br>
space<br>
^B</td>
<td>Highlight character<br>
^<br>
A single character &#8211; not space<br>
Any number of non-space characters (ie a word)<br>
A space<br>
Slot reference ref<br>
Any slot reference<br>
One or more spaces, or across slots<br>
Beginning of a slot (or line)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Replace with</em>: specifies the string to
replace each occurrence
of the
search string. The following special sequences of characters can be
used:</p>
<table class="frames">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sequence</strong></td>
<td><strong>Substitutes</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^1..^8<br>
^^<br>
^?n<br>
^#n<br>
^S<br>
^Rref<br>
^R#n<br>
space</td>
<td>Highlight character <br>
^<br>
Character matching nth&nbsp;^? in search <br>
String matching nth&nbsp;^# in search <br>
A space<br>
Slot reference ref <br>
Slot reference matching nth&nbsp;^R# <br>
Matching spaces or slot boundary</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Up to nine ^? fields, nine&nbsp;^# fields and
nine&nbsp;^R# fields,
numbered 1 to
9, can be used in the same replace string.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;^# wild field will match zero characters, as long
as the
string
which has been searched for contains at least one character (otherwise
the wild field would match all spaces).#</p>
<h3>Search and Replace examples</h3>
<p>The sequences ^1 to&nbsp;^8 represent highlight codes 1 to
8. For
example,
all occurrences of <span class="type">PipeDream</span>
could be put into bold with the
options</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;PipeDream</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="screen">^</span><span class="screen">2PipeDream^2</span></p>
<p>The sequence&nbsp;^B forces the search string to start at
the
beginning of a
line. For example, all single spaces could be removed from the
beginnings of lines with the options</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; ^B^S</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with</span></p>
<p>The sequence&nbsp;^# will match a sequence of characters
not
containing a
space; ie a word, or a number. For example, to strip line numbers from
spooled BASIC programs:</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;^B ^#</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ^S</span>
</p>
<p>Where&nbsp;^# or&nbsp;^? have been used to search for
any words or characters,
the words or characters that were found can be inserted in the <em>Replace
with</em> string using&nbsp;^#1 to&nbsp;^#9,
or&nbsp;^?1
to&nbsp;^?9 respectively. For example,</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;c^?r^? </span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^?2^?1ck</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will change <span class="type">cart</span>
to <span class="type">tack</span> and <span class="type">cord</span> to <span class="type">dock</span>.</p>
<p>The sequence&nbsp;^Rref and&nbsp;^R# respectively
match a specific slot
reference, and any slot reference, in an expression slot. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="screen">String to search for
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;^R#</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Replace with &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ^R#1+1</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will replace all slot reference A1 by A1+1, and so on.</p>
<p><em>Search only range of columns</em>: enables you
to specify a column
range by
entering a pair of column labels separated by a space: eg A G. The
command is then restricted to the specified range of columns,
inclusive.</p>
<p><em>Equate upper and lower case</em>: by default,
upper- and lower-case
letters
are treated as equivalent in the search string and the cases of letters
in the replace string are altered to match the cases of the letters in
corresponding positions of the matched string. Setting this option to <span class="screen">No</span> forces matches to be
identical case. This means that, for example,
specifying <span class="screen">Dog</span> to
replace <span class="screen">Cat</span> will have
no effect on cat or CAT.</p>
<p><em>Ask for confirmation</em>: setting this option
to <span class="screen">No</span> causes all
strings to
be replaced without prompting.</p>
<p><em>Search only marked block</em>: setting this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span>
restricts the
search to a marked block of slots.</p>
<p><em>Search from current file</em>: setting this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> performs
the
search and replace operation throughout a multi-file document, starting
at the top of the current file.</p>
<p><em>Search all files in list</em>: setting this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> performs
the
search and replace operation throughout a multi-file document, starting
at the top of the first file. See <strong>Multi-file documents</strong>,
p. 125.</p>
<h2>Other block operations</h2>
<h3>Word Count -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BWC&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Counts the words in the whole document, or in a block of slots
if one
has been marked, and displays the number of words, for example</p>
<p><span class="screen">127 words</span></p>
<p>at the top of the screen. Note that numbers and other symbols
separated
by spaces will contribute towards the word count.</p>
<h3>New -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">BNEW</h3>
<p>Clears the entire document. The query</p>
<p><span class="screen">Overwrite text?</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is given. If you clear the document (by answering <span class="screen">Yes</span>), this
will
cancel all file names and multi-file mode, resetting the Options Page
options to their defaults, and resetting the screen display to its
starting state of six columns, each 12 characters wide.</p>
<h3>Recalculate -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">A</h3>
<p>Recalculates all expression slots throughout the entire
document. The
order of recalculation is determined by the columns/rows Options Page
setting.</p>
<h1><a id="Moving about the document - CURSOR">Moving
about the document - CURSOR</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 79px;" alt="" src="images/111.png"></p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>CURSOR</strong> menu
aim to provide the greatest
possible
flexibility for moving around a document. Because they are used so
frequently, many of them have simple shorthand equivalents, which can
save you a lot of time.</p>
<p>You can move to the left or right a character, word, or column
at a
time, or to the start or end of a slot, or to the first or last column.</p>
<p>You can move up or down the document a row at a time, a
screenful at a
time, or to the top or bottom of the column.</p>
<p>You can also go directly to a specified slot by giving its
coordinates.</p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>CURSOR</strong> menu
do not modify the document in
any way,
with the exception of the&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>
command which will add a blank row at
the bottom of the document if the cursor was previously at the bottom
of the document.</p>
<h2>Moving anywhere</h2>
<h3>Go to Slot -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CGS</h3>
<p>Moves the cursor directly to a specified slot. After the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Go to
slot</span></p>
<p>type the coordinates of the slot you want to move to, followed
by&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>. If the
slot you specify is off the document, the cursor will
be moved as far as possible in the direction of the specified slot.</p>
<h3>Save Position -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CSP</h3>
<p>Saves the cursor position of the line containing the cursor in
PipeDream. If you move to a new position, you can jump back to the
previous position with the <strong>Restore Position</strong>
command. Up to five
positions can be saved.</p>
<h3>Restore Position - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CRP</h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the last position saved. If five positions
have
already been saved, the <strong>Save Position</strong>
command will give a bleep
warning.</p>
<h2>Moving within a line/slot</h2>
<h3>Cursor Right - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"><br>
Cursor Left -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the next character in the slot, or the
previous
character in the slot respectively. <strong>Cursor Left</strong>
will have no effect
once the cursor reaches the beginning of the slot. <strong>Cursor
Right</strong> will
continue to move the cursor beyond the end of the slot, scrolling the
slot left if it reaches the wrap point for the column.</p>
<h3>Next Word -&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"><br>
Previous Word - <span class="key">SHiFT</span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the first character of the next word in
the slot,
and the previous word in the slot respectively. If there are no more
words in the current slot, <strong>Next Word</strong> will
move the cursor to the first
character of the next slot. Likewise, if the cursor is at the beginning
of a slot, <strong>Previous Word</strong> will move the
cursor to the end of the
previous slot.</p>
<h3>Beginning of Line - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the first character position in the slot.</p>
<h3>End of
Line -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the position after the last character in
the slot.</p>
<h2>Moving within a column</h2>
<h3>ENTER -&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor down to the next row and to the first
character
position in the current column. If the cursor is at the bottom of the
document, the command will add an extra row to the document.</p>
<h3>Cursor Up - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png"><br>
Cursor Down -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the same horizontal position in the
previous line
and the next line respectively: the cursor remains in the current
column. <strong>Cursor Up</strong> will have no effect if
the cursor is already on the
top line of the document, and <strong>Cursor Down</strong>
will have no effect if the
cursor is already on the bottom line of the document.</p>
<h3>Screen Up -&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png"><br>
Screen Down -&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor up or down a screenful at a time. With
borders
displayed this will be five lines at a time.</p>
<h3>Top of Column - <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png"><br>
Bottom of Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the top or bottom of the current column in
the
document respectively.</p>
<h2>Moving between columns</h2>
<h3>First Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CFC or&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><span class="key">TAB</span><br>
Last Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">CLC</h3>
<p>These commands move the cursor to the first or left-most
column on the
document, and last or right-most column on the document respectively.
The cursor stays in the same row, but will be moved to the first
(left-most) character position in the specified column.</p>
<h3>Next Column - <span class="key">TAB</span><br>
Previous Column - <span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">TAB</span></h3>
<p>Moves the cursor to the next column on the right, or
the previous column on the left, respectively. The cursor remains in
the same row, but moves to the beginning of the slot in the new column.</p>
<h2>Summary of PipeDream cursor operations</h2>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 285px;" alt="" src="images/114.png"></p>
<h1><a id="Editing text and expressions - EDIT">Editing
text and expressions - EDIT</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 81px;" alt="" src="images/115.png"></p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>EDIT</strong> menu
provide for various
modifications on the
contents of document. In the first place, there are commands which
allow you to delete a character, word, slot, row or column on the
document.</p>
<p>You can also insert a row or a column, join two slots or split
a slot,
and insert a page break.</p>
<p>Some of these commands are especially useful when working with
multi-column documents: see <strong>Widths and margins in a
multi-column
document</strong>, p. 129.</p>
<p>The remaining commands are divided into two groups; the first
applies
specifically to working with text, the second to working with
expression slots:</p>
<p><strong>Format Paragraph</strong> reformats a
paragraph of text within a
column, <strong>Swap
Case</strong> swaps the case of a single character, and <strong>Insert/Overtype</strong>
changes
PipeDream between Insert and Overtype text entry modes.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Expression</strong> allows you to
enter an expression, <strong>Number to
Text</strong>
converts between an expression slot and a text slot and <strong>Insert
Reference</strong> inserts a slot reference into an expression.</p>
<h2>Editing within a line/slot</h2>
<h3>Insert/Overtype -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">V</h3>
<p>Switches the text entry mode between Insert and Overtype. The
mode
currently selected is displayed on the top line of the Options Page.</p>
<p>In <strong>Insert mode</strong>, characters typed
are inserted at the cursor
position,
and subsequent text on the line moves apart to make space.</p>
<p>In <strong>Overtype mode</strong>, characters
type over any text previously on
the same
line, in the same way as a correcting typewriter works.</p>
<p>The mode you choose to work in is a matter of personal
preference. The
selected mode is specific to each PipeDream suspended activity; the
default mode can be set in the Panel.</p>
<h3>Rubout - <span class="key">DEL</span></h3>
<p>The <strong>Rubout</strong> command, normally
used by pressing the <span class="key">DEL</span>
key,
deletes to the
left. Then <span class="key">DEL</span> key is used
to remove a mistake in the line you have just
typed. In Insert mode the remaining characters on the line move one
position to the left. Note that <span class="key">DEL</span>
will not jump back to the previous
line when the left-hand margin of a page is reached.</p>
<h3>Delete Character -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">G or&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">DEL</span></h3>
<p>Deletes to the right. You would normally use the <strong>Delete
Character</strong>
command to delete one or more characters in the middle of a line of
text.</p>
<h3>Insert Character -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">U</h3>
<p>Inserts a space at the cursor position, leaving the cursor
where it is
and moving subsequent text on the line to the right. The <strong>Insert
Character</strong> command is used when working in Overtype mode,
to create
spaces in which to insert additional text within a line.</p>
<h3>Delete Word -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">T</h3>
<p>Deletes all the characters from the current cursor position,
up to but
not including the first character of the next word. Normally you would
position the cursor at the beginning of the word you want to delete,
using the <strong>Next Word</strong> and <strong>Previous
Word</strong> commands, and then give the
<strong>Delete Word</strong> command to delete everything
up to the next word. Note that
<strong>Delete Word</strong> will not delete beyond the end
of the current slot.</p>
<h3>Delete to End of Slot -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">D</h3>
<p>Deletes all characters from the current cursor position to the
end of
the slot.</p>
<h3>Swap Case -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">S</h3>
<p>Changes the case of the character under the cursor, and moves
the
cursor one position to the right.</p>
<h2>Editing within a column</h2>
<h3>Delete Row in Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EDRC</h3>
<p>Deletes the slot containing the cursor and closes up the gap,
so that
subsequent rows in the current column move up on the document. This
command will typically be used when PipeDream is operating in Columns
mode, so that the text in the current column does not have to remain
aligned with the text in adjacent columns.</p>
<h3>Insert Row in Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EIRC</h3>
<p>Inserts a row in the column containing the cursor. Subsequent
rows in
the current column are moved down to make space. The <strong>Insert
Row in
Column</strong> command is typically used when working in Columns
mode, as it
does not affect the text in columns to either side of the column
containing the cursor. It is also useful for restoring the alignment of
a table containing items in different columns.</p>
<h3>Join Lines -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EJL</h3>
<p>Joins the text in the line below the current line onto the end
of the
current line, and closes up the gap so that subsequent slots in the
current column are moved up one row.</p>
<h3>Split Line -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">ESL</h3>
<p>Splits the current line at the cursor position. The character
at the
cursor position and subsequent characters are moved to the next row and
the cursor remains at the end of the current slot.</p>
<h3>Format Paragraph -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">R</h3>
<p>Reformats text from the line containing the cursor to the end
of the
paragraph. The lines of text will be split at the last space before the
right-hand margin for the current column; see <strong>Starting
PipeDream</strong>, p.
36. If justification has been selected, with the Options Page <em>Justify</em>
option (see p. 136), additional spaces will be added to each line to
make the right-hand end always coincide with the wrap point. The end of
the paragraph is determined by one of the following:</p>
<p>A line beginning with at least one space</p>
<p>An expression slot</p>
<p>A slot with alignment other than free align; in other words,
left
align, right align or LCR align.</p>
<p>You can prevent words from being split at a space by
typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">space,
which is called an 'exact space' and is displayed on the screen
as '...'. For example,</p>
<p><span class="screen">27 ...KHz</span></p>
<h2>Editing a document</h2>
<h3>Delete Row -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">Y
or&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"><span class="key">DEL</span></h3>
<p>Deletes the row containing the cursor across the entire
document,
closing up the gap. This command should be used with care, since the
slot in every column on the current row will be deleted. The command is
typically used when PipeDream is operating in Rows mode, in order to
maintain alignment between text in adjacent columns.</p>
<h3>Delete Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EDC</h3>
<p>Deletes the column containing the cursor. Note that all
information in
the column will be lost, so use this command with caution.</p>
<h3>Insert Page -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EIP</h3>
<p>Normally, page breaks are inserted automatically by PipeDream.
These
are called 'soft' page breaks, and are represented by a horizontal line</p>
<p><span class="screen">^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</span></p>
<p>across the document between two rows. Their position will
change if you
alter the amount of text on a page, or change the margin settings on
the Options Page.</p>
<p>However, to force a page break to occur at a specific place in
the
document, such as before a new chapter, you can insert a 'hard' page
break with the <strong>Insert Page</strong> command. Hard
page breaks are displayed as a
row on the document</p>
<p><span class="screen">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>Using this command will insert a hard page break in the row
containing
the cursor. The command gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Specify no. of unbroken
lines &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressing&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>
executes the command, thereby ensuring that
subsequent
text
will always start at the top of a new page.</p>
<p>Alternatively, altering the option to <span class="screen">Yes</span>
followed by a
number enters
a conditional hard page break. This means that a page break win occur
if less than the specified number of lines is available on the current
page. For example, before a table of ten lines one might insert a
conditional hard page break with a value of 10 to ensure that all ten
lines of the table were on the same page.</p>
<p>If the conditional hard page break does not cause a page
break, it will
be displayed in column A as:</p>
<p><span class="screen">~n</span></p>
<h3>Insert Row -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">N</h3>
<p>Inserts a blank row across the entire document before the row
containing the cursor. Subsequent rows are moved down to make space.
The <strong>Insert Row</strong> command is typically used
when working in Rows mode (see
the Options Page), since it maintains alignment between text in
adjacent columns.</p>
<h3>Insert Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EIC</h3>
<p>Inserts a blank column to the left of the column containing
the cursor.
The new column is created with an initial width of 12 characters, and
an initial wrap-width of zero. The cursor remains in the new column.</p>
<h3>Add Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">EAC</h3>
<p>Adds a blank column at the right-hand side of the document.
The new
column is added with an initial width of 12 characters, and a
wrap-width of zero so that text in the new column will wrap at the
right-hand edge of the column.</p>
<h2>Editing expression slots</h2>
<h3>Insert Reference -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">K</h3>
<p>Enables expressions to be built up by indicating, or 'pointing
to',
various slots to which an expression will refer. It inserts the
coordinates of the slot containing the cursor into the expression being
edited. To perform the command, move the block cursor to the required
slot using the cursor keys, and type&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">K.</p>
<p>If an expression is not being edited, this command will have
no effect.</p>
<h3>Edit Expression -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">X</h3>
<p>Sets the slot containing the cursor to an expression slot, or
edits an
existing expression slot.</p>
<p>The slot is highlighted, and the cursor moves to the editing
line above
the top border at the centre of the screen. The current contents of the
slot, if any, are displayed, and they can be edited using the cursor
keys and line editing commands:</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="key">DEL</span><br>
<span class="key">SHIFT</span> <span class="key">DEL</span><br>
<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">V<br>
<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">U<br>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Finally press&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>
to enter the expression into the slot
and display
its value, or <span class="key">ESC</span> to leave
the slot's previous value unaltered.</p>
<h3>Escape - <span class="key">ESC</span></h3>
<p>Exits from the Options Page, or from the options of any
PipeDream
command. <span class="key">ESC</span> will also
abandon the editing of an expression and leave
the contents of the slot being edited unchanged.</p>
<h3>Number &lt; &gt; Text -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">ENT</h3>
<p>Converts the slot containing the cursor between an expression
slot and
a text slot. This command allows a number inadvertently entered as text
to be converted to an expression, or the equation in an expression slot
to be displayed as text so that it can be printed out.</p>
<p>The following procedure can be used to display, or print out,
all the
expressions within a particular area of a spreadsheet or document:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the document first, as the procedure will alter it.</li>
<li>Mark as much of the document as you wish to examine or
print
out.</li>
<li>Type&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">ENT.
Expression slots within the marked block will
display
the expressions they contain. Note that text slots will display the
error <span class="type">Typing error</span>.</li>
<li>Press&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">Q to
clear the marked block, and, if necessary,
increase the
column widths so that the full expressions can be seen.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a id="Working with files - FILES">Working with
files - FILES</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 80px;" alt="" src="images/122.png"></p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>FILES</strong> menu
allow you to load documents
from the
Cambridge Z88 filing system, and save documents to the filing system.</p>
<p>You can create a document consisting of several files linked
together
by a List file. Commands are available to move to the next file or
previous file, or go directly to the first file or last file in a
multi-file document.</p>
<p>For simple use of PipeDream you do not need to use files,
since you can
leave documents you are working on as suspended applications. However,
since there is a small overhead in keeping suspended applications,
saving a large number of small documents as files will prevent the
inconveniences of memory low conditions.</p>
<h2>File names</h2>
<p>When you start PipeDream with a blank document, the document
will have
no File name associated with it, and it will show:</p>
<p><span class="screen">File No File</span></p>
<p>at the top right-hand side of the Options Page. A File name
can be
given to a document with the <strong>Name</strong>
command. Loading a file, with the
<strong>Load</strong> command, will set the File name to
the name of the loaded file.</p>
<p>The File name of the document is displayed in the Options
Page, and is
used as the default file name in the options for the <strong>Save</strong>
and <strong>Name</strong>
commands. The File name is also used to label PipeDream suspended
activities, in the Index YOUR REF. column.</p>
<h3>Name -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FC</h3>
<p>Sets the File name for the current document. Gives the prompt:</p>
<p><span class="frames screen">New name of file</span></p>
<p>The current File name, if any, will be displayed; this should
be edited
to the
new name, followed by&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>.</p>
<h2>Loading a document</h2>
<h3>Load -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FL</h3>
<p>Loads a document of a given name from the filing system. The
following
options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Name of file to</span><span class="screen"> load<br>
Insert at slot &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Limit to range of rows &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Load as plain text &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Name of file to load</em>: specifies the file
name. If a file of
the same
name but with the extension'<span class="type">.L</span>'
exists, this file is taken as a List
file; see <strong>Multi-file documents</strong>, p. 125.
If not, the specified file is
loaded.</p>
<p>The File name, displayed in the Options Page, will be set to
the name
of the file loaded. In the case of a multi-file document, this will be
the name of the current document, not the name of the List file.</p>
<p>Instead of typing the file name, the file can be selected from
the
Filer. After typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FL, call
the Filer by typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png">F, and
select the
required document using the cursor keys followed by&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span> (see
<strong>Selecting files</strong>, p. 85). You can then
return to PipeDream from the
Filer by pressing&nbsp;<span class="key">ESC</span>,
and the full file name will have been entered
for you. Press&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>
to load the file.</p>
<p>If the document in memory has been altered since last saving
it, the
message</p>
<p><span class="screen">Overwrite text?</span></p>
<p>will be displayed, and the document will only be loaded if <span class="type">Y</span>
(or <span class="type">y</span>) is
typed. If the document is too large to fit into memory, only the first
section will be loaded, and the display will show the message</p>
<p><span class="screen">Memory full</span></p>
<p><em>Insert at slot</em>: appends the file to the
document already in
memory,
either at the specified slot reference, or at the current cursor
position if no slot reference is specified. Type <span class="type">Y</span>
for the option</p>
<p><span class="screen">Insert at slot &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes</span> </p>
<p>and enter a slot reference.</p>
<p><em>Limit to range of rows</em>: enables files too
large for the
available
memory to be edited by splitting them up into sections. If the option
is set to <span class="screen">Yes</span>, a range
of rows can be entered as two numbers
separated by a space. Only rows lying between the specified range,
inclusive, will be loaded.</p>
<p><em>Load as plain text</em>: if <span class="screen">Yes</span> is specified, the file is
interpreted as
plain text. Sections of text on each line separated by tabs are put
into successive columns across each row of the PipeDream document.</p>
<p>After loading a document, expression slots are recalculated
twice, once
to obtain the correct values of constant slots, and then again to
ensure that references to constant slots have the correct values. If
the document contains complicated forward referencing, it may need
further recalculation before the values of slots stabilise.</p>
<h2>Saving a document</h2>
<h3>Save -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> FS</h3>
<p>If none of the options are changed, pressing&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span> saves the
whole of
the current document to the name last set by the <strong>Load</strong>
or <strong>Name</strong> commands.</p>
<p>The following options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Name&nbsp;of file to
save&nbsp;</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Save only range of columns &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Save selection of rows &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Save marked block &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Save plain text
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Name of file to save</em>: by default, the
current File name is
displayed,
as shown in the Options Page. This can be edited to save the document
under a different name.</p>
<p><em>Save only range of columns</em>: altering this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span>
allows you to
specify a range of columns. This should be given as two column labels,
separated by a space: for example, A F. Only the text within the range
of columns, inclusive, will be saved.</p>
<p><em>Save selection of rows</em>: altering this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> allows
you to
enter an expression. Only rows for which the expression evaluates to
TRUE will be saved.</p>
<p>For example, column E in an inventory of goods may represent
the
quantity of each item in stock. To save a copy of the database which
excluded out-of-stock items, you would type</p>
<p><span class="screen">Save selection of rows
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes
E1&gt;0</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All row references in the expression are incremented before
the
expression is evaluated for each row in the document. So in this
example row 6 will be saved if E6&gt;0.</p>
<p><em>Save marked block</em>: altering this option
to <span class="screen">Yes</span> specifies that
only the
marked block of text should be saved.</p>
<p><em>Save plain text</em>: altering this option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> will save the
document as
a plain text file, containing no special constructs. The contents of
each successive column will be output separated by tab characters, with
each row terminated by a return character.</p>
<h2>Multi-file documents</h2>
<p>Documents comprised of several different files can be edited
and
printed as a single document by means of a PipeDream List
file</p>
<p>The List file is a plain text file containing the names of all
the
files making up the entire document. It should be saved with the <em>Save
plain text</em> option, with each file name on a separate line.</p>
<p>The List file should be given a name with the extension'<span class="type">.L</span>'.
A file
with extension'<span class="type">.L</span>' is
taken as a List file when loading, and the first
document in the list will be loaded.</p>
<p>Any error which occurs during the processing of a multi-file
document
cancels the multi-file mode after reporting the error, to avoid
overwriting files with incorrect text.</p>
<p>The following commands provide a convenient way of moving
between files
in a multi-file document:</p>
<h3>Next File -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FN&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Loads the next file in a multi-file document, but first saves
the
current file if it has been altered since the last save
command.</p>
<h3>Previous File -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FP&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Loads the previous file in a multi-file document. The current
document
is saved if it has been altered since last saving it.</p>
<h3>Top File -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FT</h3>
<p>Loads the first file in a multi-file document. The current
document is
first saved if it has been altered since last saving it.</p>
<h3>Bottom File -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FB</h3>
<p>Loads the last document in a multi-file document. The current
document
is first saved if it has been altered since last saving it.</p>
<h3>Multi-file example</h3>
<p>For example, first create a List file in PipeDream, containing
the
following text:</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 92px;" alt="" src="images/126.png"></p>
<p>Take care not to add any blank lines after the last file name.
Then
save this as a plain text file called <span class="type">book.L</span>,
by typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FS <span class="type">book.L</span>,
and setting the <em>Save plain text</em> option to <span class="screen">Y</span>.</p>
<p>Create three files, <span class="type">chapterone</span>,
<span class="type">chaptertwo</span>, and <span class="type">chapterthree</span>,
containing, for example, the following lines of text respectively:</p>
<p><span class="type">This is the first chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="type">This is the second chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="type">This is chapter three</span></p>
<p>Now load the multi-file document by typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FL <span class="type">book</span>.
If you
use the
Filer to select the file you will need to delete the '<span class="type">.L</span>' extension
from the end of the file name.</p>
<p>Typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FN,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FP,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FT, and&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FB will then move between the
three
files.</p>

<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 81px;" alt="" src="images/128.png"></p>
<p>The commands in the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu
allow you to specify how the
information entered in a document is displayed.</p>
<p>You can alter the width that any column occupies, and the
column's
right-hand margin, which determines the point at which lines of text
entered into that column wrap onto the next line.</p>
<p>You can also fix rows above the cursor position and columns to
the left
of the cursor position so that you can see information on one part of
the document while editing information on another part.</p>
<h2>Column widths and margins</h2>
<h3>Width -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">W</h3>
<p>Specifies the width that a column occupies on the document.
The
following options are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">New width</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Specify column &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no column is specified, the column currently containing the
cursor
is assumed.</p>
<h3>Set Margin -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">H</h3>
<p>Alters the right-hand margin of a specified column. The margin
is
indicated by the right-hand margin pointer, <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right-hand margin pointer" src="images/symb_pointer.png">, on the top border, and
determines the point at which text typed into the column will wrap onto
the next line.</p>
<p>This command determines the area over which text is to be
formatted
within the column; thus, if the width is set to zero, it will be equal
to the column width, and there will be no margin. The following options
are displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">New width</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Specify column &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no column is specified, the column containing the cursor
will be
assumed.</p>
<h3>Margin Left -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png"><br>
Margin Right -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"></h3>
<p>These commands allow you to move the right-hand margin for a
number of
columns simultaneously.</p>
<p>The commands move the right-hand margin pointer, <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right-hand margin pointer" src="images/symb_pointer.png">, for the
column
containing the cursor one character position to the left or right
respectively. They also set the wrap point of all columns between the
current column and the wrap point so that they wrap at the same
position.</p>
<h2>Widths and margins in a multi-column document</h2>
<p>By default, the wrap point for all columns is set to the
right-hand
edge of the screen, which is most appropriate for creating tables of
information within a single column of text. The <strong>Insert
on wrap</strong> option
on the Options Page is initially set to Rows, ensuring that information
in adjacent columns will remain aligned.</p>
<p>It is also possible to create a document with two or more
independent
columns of text, like the layout of a newspaper.</p>
<p>You do this by moving the right-hand margin for each column to
the
right-hand edge of the column. Setting the <strong>Insert on wrap</strong>
Options Page
option to Columns will then ensure that the text in each column can be
edited without affecting adjacent columns.</p>
<p>For example, the following steps can be used to create the
three-column
document shown below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the widths of columns A, B, and C to 24, by
giving the <strong>Width</strong>
command on the <strong>LAYOUT</strong> menu with the
options
<p><span class="screen">New width &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24</span><br>
<span class="screen">Specify column &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes A</span></p>
<p><span class="screen">New width &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24</span><br>
<span class="screen">Specify column
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes B</span></p>
<p><span class="screen">New width &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24</span><br>
<span class="screen">Specify column
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Yes C</span></p>
</li>
<li>With the cursor in column A,&nbsp;move the right-hand
margin to the right-hand edge of column A by pressing <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="square" src="images/symb_square.png"><img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png"> until the
right-hand margin pointer is just to the left of the A on the top
border; see the diagram below. This will also position the left margin
for columns B and C to the right-hand edge of those columns.</li>
<li>Enter the Options Page, by typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">O, and alter the <strong>Insert
on wrap</strong> option to Columns by pressing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"> until the cursor is on the
option line, and typing C to alter it to
<p><span class="screen">Insert on wrap
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C</span></p>
<p>Press <span class="key">ESC</span> to
exit from the Options Page.</p>
</li>
<li>Type the required text into each column; it will format
automatically within the column width.</li>
</ol>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 91px;" alt="" src="images/130.png"></p>
<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>Text can be aligned in one of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Left-aligned with the left-hand edge of the column.</li>
<li>Right-aligned with the right-hand margin pointer.</li>
<li>Centred between the left-hand edge of the column and the
right-hand margin pointer.</li>
<li>Components of the line can be left-aligned, centred, and
right-aligned (LCR alignment).</li>
</ol>
<p>Text in a slot which has been aligned with one of the <strong>Align</strong>
commands will not be reformatted by the <strong>Format Paragraph</strong>
command.</p>
<p>The results of expression slots can similarly be displayed
left-aligned, centred, or right-aligned over the width of the column.</p>
<h3>Right
ight Align -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> LAR<br>
Left Align -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> LAL</h3>
<p>Aligns the text in the current slot to the right or left of
the wrap-width of the current column, respectively. The alignment will
be displayed when the cursor is moved off the slot. The <strong>Left
Align</strong>
command can, for example, be used to prevent text in a table from being
inadvertently re-formatted with the <strong>Format Paragraph</strong>
command.</p>
<h3>Centre Align -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> LAC</h3>
<p>Centres the text in the slot containing the cursor, or a
marked block of slots, over the wrap-width of the column containing it.</p>
<h3>LCR Align -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> LLCR</h3>
<p>Aligns components of the slot containing the cursor, or the
slots within a marked block, to the left, centre, and right of the
column's text wrap-width. The line has the format</p>
<p><span class="screen">/left/centre/right/</span></p>
<p>where left, centre, and right represent text which will be
respectively left-aligned, centred and right-aligned, and '/'
represents
an arbitrary delimiter, which must not occur elsewhere in the line of
text.</p>
<h3>Free Align -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png"> LAF</h3>
<p>Removes the alignment from a slot containing the cursor, or a
marked block of slots. Text, or the results of expression slots, will
be left-aligned in the slot.</p>
<h2>Fixing rows and columns&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Fix Row -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">
LFR&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Fixes the row containing the cursor, and all rows above it, on
the screen. If borders are displayed, the fixed rows are identified
with horizontal lines in the left-hand border. Moving the cursor up or
down on the document will scroll only those rows which have not been
fixed, so the cursor can be moved to another part of the document while
retaining the fixed rows on the screen. Giving the <strong>Fix
Row</strong> command
again frees the rows and restores the document to its original
state.</p>
<h3>Fix Column -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LFC</h3>
<p>Fixes the column containing the cursor, and all columns to its
left, on the screen. If borders are displayed, the fixed columns are
identified in the top border by solid lines. If the cursor is moved on
the document, only the columns that have not been fixed will scroll, so
that the cursor can be moved to another part of the document while
retaining the fixed columns on the screen. Giving the <strong>Fix
Column</strong>
command again frees the columns.</p>
<p>For example, the top row of headings and leftmost column of
labels have been fixed in the following document by giving the
commands&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LFR
and&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LFC with
the cursor in slot A1:</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 91px;" alt="" src="images/132.png"></p>
<p>The cursor can then be moved around to scroll the document
while keeping the column headings and row labels in view.</p>
<h2>Number formats&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Expressions can be displayed with a specified number of
decimal places, or in free format. Negative numbers can be displayed
either with a minus sign, or with brackets as in financial notation.
The results of expression slots can also be displayed with one or more
leading
characters, such as '' and one or more trailing characters, such as
'%'. The leading and trailing characters for the document are specified
in the Options Page.</p>
<p>The format in which any expression slot is displayed can be
restored to the default specified in the Options Page by the <strong>Default
Format</strong> command.</p>
<p>All the format commands can be applied either to the single
slot containing the cursor, or to a block of slots by marking them
before giving the command.</p>
<h3>Decimal Places -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LDP&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Sets the number of decimal places displayed by an expression
slot, or a marked block of expression slots. Gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Number of decimal
places&nbsp;</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Floating format
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; No</span></p>
<p>The number of decimal places may be set to a value from 0 to
9, or floating format may be specified which uses the display format
giving the most significant figures displayed in the available
width.</p>
<h3>Sign Brackets -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LSB <br>
Sign Minus -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LSM&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Specify that negative values in an expression slot or marked
block of expression slots should be displayed in financial notation,
enclosed in brackets, or with a minus sign prefix
respectively.</p>
<h3>Leading Characters -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LCL&nbsp;<br>
Trailing Characters -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LCT&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Specify that the leading or trailing characters defined in the
Options Page should be displayed for the expression slot contained in
the cursor or the marked block of expression slots. The default leading
and trailing characters are '' and '%' respectively, and these can be
altered on the Options Page.</p>
<h3>Default Format -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LDF&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Restores the expression slot containing the cursor, or a
marked block of expression slots, to the default format as specified on
the Options Page. Once any element of an expression slot's format
has been altered with one of the commands <strong>Decimal Places</strong>,
<strong>Sign
Brackets</strong>, <strong>Sign Minus</strong>, <strong>Leading
Characters</strong> or
<strong>Trailing Characters</strong>, the slot's format is
frozen and not be affected by
subsequent alterations to the Options Page. Giving the <strong>Default
Format</strong>
command removes any specific format set on the slot.</p>
<h1><a id="Document options - OPTIONS">Document
options - OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 81px;" alt="" src="images/134.png"></p>
<p>The <strong>OPTIONS</strong> menu contains only
one command, <strong>Options Page</strong>,
or&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">O, which displays a page of
information about the current document
together with the global settings which may be altered to effect the
way that commands operate on the document.</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 91px;" alt="" src="images/134_2.png"></p>
<p>You can return to a PipeDream document by pressing
the&nbsp;<span class="key">ESC</span>
key.</p>
<h2>Information lines&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The right-hand column of the Options Page display gives
information about the current document.</p>
<h3>File&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The name of the document previously loaded with the <strong>Load</strong>
command, or the name assigned to a document by the <strong>Name</strong>
command (<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">FC)
on the <strong>FILES</strong> menu. If no name has been
specified, it will show</p>
<p><span class="screen">No File</span></p>
<p>The name will also appear on the SUSPENDED ACTIVITIES list in
the Index display.</p>
<h3>Page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Shows the current page number of the line containing the
cursor. This will correspond to the page numbering when the document is
printed unless rows are fixed with the <strong>Fix Row</strong>
command on the <strong>LAYOUT</strong>
menu, or the Options Page page-length setting has been set to
zero.</p>
<h3>Insert/Overtype&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Shows the current text entry mode selected by the
<strong>Insert/Overtype</strong> command on the <strong>EDIT</strong>
menu. The mode initially selected
is Insert mode.</p>
<h3>Microspace&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Normally blank, displays the word <span class="screen">Microspace</span>
if the
microspace option has been selected from the <strong>PRINT</strong>
menu.</p>
<h3>Free&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Displays the amount of space remaining for characters in the
current document, to the nearest multiple of 256 characters. It is
inadvisable to continue typing text into a document if there are less
than approximately 300 free characters. In such a situation you are
advised to make space in memory by freeing activities, or deleting
files.</p>
<h2>Option lines&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This page is used to determine how text and expressions are
displayed in a document (including the default setting for the display
of expression results) and to set up the layout of a document ready for
printing, specifying headers and footers, and margins at the top,
bottom and left of the page. In addition, you can control the length of
the page, the spacing of text, and the page numbering.</p>
<h3>Altering options - Next Option&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As with many other commands, Next Option,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">J will alternate
between two available values, for example <span class="screen">Y</span>
and <span class="screen">N</span> for <span class="screen">Yes</span> and <span class="screen">No</span>,
or
<span class="screen">T</span> and <span class="screen">N</span> for <span class="screen">Text</span>
and <span class="screen">Numbers</span>.
Alternatively, these values can be
changed by typing the appropriate letter. In the case of options with
more than two possible values,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">J will set the option back to
its
default value.</p>
<p>Other options can be altered by moving the cursor to the
appropriate item, with the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="up" src="images/symb_up.png"> and&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="down" src="images/symb_down.png"> keys, and then editing the item
with the line-editing
commands <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">, <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png">, <span class="key">DEL</span>
key and <img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">G or <span class="key">SHIFT</span>
<span class="key">DEL</span> to delete
the character
under the
cursor. In numeric fields, such as <strong>Page length</strong>,
Overtype mode is
automatically set irrespective of the current Overtype/Insert mode
setting.</p>
<p>In the following list of options the default value is shown
against each option.</p>
<h2>Text format&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Determines the formatting of text in the document.</p>
<h3>Text/Numbers (T)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">T</span>
(Text) to make the default slot format text slots, or
<span class="screen">N</span> (Numbers) for
expression slots. In Numbers mode there is no need to
type&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">X before
entering an expression, and the cursor keys&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="right" src="images/symb_right.png"> and&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="left" src="images/symb_left.png">
will move directly between slots containing expressions; ie behave
like&nbsp;<span class="key">TAB</span>
and&nbsp;<span class="key">SHIFT</span>&nbsp;<span class="key">TAB</span>.</p>
<h3>Borders (Y)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">Y</span> (Yes)
to display borders, or <span class="screen">N</span>
(No) to hide borders.
Hiding the borders allows a larger area of the sheet to be displayed,
and can be useful for word-processing applications.</p>
<h3>Justify (N)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">N</span> (No
justify) for ragged right margins, or <span class="screen">Y</span>
(Yes) for
even right-hand margins. To reformat a paragraph of text after changing
this option, give the <span class="screen">Format
Paragraph</span> command,&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">R.</p>
<h3>Wrap (Y)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">Y</span> (Yes)
to make text wrap automatically at the wrap
point, or <span class="screen">N</span> (No) for no
wrapping.</p>
<h3>Insert on wrap (R)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">R</span>
(Rows) to maintain alignment between adjacent rows,
or <span class="screen">C</span> (Columns) for
creating independent columns of text; see <strong>Widths and
margins in a multi-column document</strong>, p. 129.</p>
<h2>Recalculation mode&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The <span class="screen">Calc</span>
options determine how expression slots are
recalculated in the document.</p>
<h3>Auto/Man (A)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Determines the recalculation of expression slots on the
document.</p>
<p>Set to <span class="screen">A</span>
(Automatic) to recalculate the document every time an
expression slot changes or <span class="screen">M</span>
(Manual) for recalculation only with
the&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">A
command. This option can be set to <span class="screen">M</span>
to make entering data into a
large spreadsheet, or working with large text documents,
faster.</p>
<h3>Columns/Rows (C)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Select the order of recalculation: <span class="screen">R</span>
(Rows) across rows first,
or <span class="screen">C</span> (Columns) down
columns first.</p>
<h2>Number formats&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Determine the default display format for numerical expression
slots.</p>
<h3>Decimal places (2)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Select 0 to 9 decimal places or <span class="screen">F</span>
for free format.</p>
<h3>Minus/brackets (M)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Select <span class="screen">M</span>
(Minus) to display negative numbers with a minus
sign, or <span class="screen">B</span> (Brackets)
for financial bracketed notation.</p>
<h3>Lead chs. () <br>
Trail chs. (%)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Specify up to 4 characters to be displayed in front of or
after expression slots with&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LCL or&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">LCT set.</p>
<h2>Page format&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Determines the spacing and pagination of the document when
printed.</p>
<h3>Page length (66)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Set to between 1 and 127 to specify the number of lines on
each page, including margins, footer and header, or 0 to suppress page
breaks altogether.</p>
<h3>Line spacing (1)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can specify from 0 to 255 additional blank lines to be
inserted between each line of text.</p>
<h3>Start page&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can set the current page number to 0 to 255.</p>
<h2>Headers, footers, and margins&nbsp;</h2>
<p>You can specify an additional header or footer line of text to
appear at the top or bottom of each printed page respectively. Each
line of text can consist of up to three components, which will be
left-aligned, centred, and right-aligned.</p>
<p>The left margin, and the margins above and below the header
and footer, and between the header and footer and the page of text, can
be separately altered to determine the layout of the printed
page.</p>
<p>Note that if a header or footer are specified, the number of
lines of text on each page will be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p><img style="width: 277px; height: 360px;" alt="" src="images/139.png"></p>
<p>The complete page layout, with headers and footers and their
associated margins, will be represented on the page map display at the
right-hand side of the PipeDream screen.</p>
<h3>Header&nbsp;<br>
Footer&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can specify lines of text which will be printed out at the
head and foot of each page. Each line has the format</p>
<p><span class="screen">/left/centre/right/</span></p>
<p>where left, centre, and right represent text which will be
respectively left-aligned, centred and right-aligned, and '/'
represents
an arbitrary delimiter, which must not occur elsewhere in the line of
text.</p>
<h3>Title&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A line of up to 244 characters can be entered in this field as
a title for the document. The title can be included in the document, or
in the footer or header, by giving the @T@ field; see p. 153.</p>
<h2>Margins&nbsp;</h2>
<p>You can specify the number of blank lines, from 0 to 255, to
be left above the header, between header and text, between text and
footer, and below the footer respectively. The left margin can specify
a margin of 0 to 255 characters at the left of each page:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Margins: Top 0
</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Header 2
</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Footer 2
</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bottom 8
</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; Left 0</span></p>
<p>For example, a typical set-up might be</p>
<p class="screen">Margins: Top 2 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Header 2 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Footer 2 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bottom 2&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Left 6
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Header /@T@//Maxo Ltd/&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Footer //Page @P@//</p>
<p><span class="screen">&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;Title Quarterly Report</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;@-field <span class="screen">@P@</span>
will be replaced by the current page
number, and the&nbsp;@-field <span class="screen">@T@</span>
by the Title. The resulting page
layout would be as follows:</p>
<p><img style="width: 276px; height: 361px;" alt="" src="images/140.png"></p>
<h1><a id="Printing documents - PRINT">Printing
documents - PRINT</a></h1>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 79px;" alt="" src="images/141.png"></p>
<p>The commands on the <strong>PRINT</strong> menu
allow you to print your
document and to take advantage of facilities offered by the printer,
such as bold and underlined text, and alternative fonts.</p>
<h3>Print -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PO&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Prints all or part of a document. The following options are
displayed:</p>
<p><span class="screen">Print only range of columns
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Select rows to print
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span><br class="screen">
<span class="screen">Wait between pages &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the <strong>Print</strong> command
prints the whole of the current
document with no pause between pages.</p>
<p>The starting page number is determined by the Options Page
<strong>Start page</strong> setting, except when printing a
marked block, or selected
rows. In this case the pages will be numbered, starting at 1, and soft
page breaks will be ignored.</p>
<p><em>Print only range of columns</em>: setting this
option to <span class="screen">Yes</span> will
allow a column range to be specified. The column range should be given
as two column labels, separated by a space. Only the columns within the
specified range (inclusive) will be printed.</p>
<p><em>Select rows to print</em>: setting this option
to <span class="screen">Yes</span> will allow
an expression to be entered. Rows will only be printed if the
expression evaluates to a true or nonzero result. The expression can
contain slot references; after each row the slot references are updated
by one row, unless they are fixed with the $ operator.</p>
<p>For example, a document containing text in column B could use
column A to contain a '*' character, indicating the latest revisions to
the document. To print out only the revised lines the option</p>
<p><span class="screen">Select rows to print
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes A1="*"</span></p>
<p>could be specified. See also <strong>Printing selected
rows</strong>, p. 57,
for an example.</p>
<p><em>Wait between pages</em>: setting this option
to <span class="screen">Yes</span> gives a prompt
between pages to allow single sheets to be inserted into the printer.
The prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Page n ..</span></p>
<p>is displayed, where n is the page number. You can then press
one of the following keys to control printing:</p>
<p><span class="type">M</span> to miss the
page
<br>
<span class="type">C</span> to continue printing all
remaining pages without further prompting <br>
Any other character (eg the space bar) to print the page
<br>
<span class="key">ESC</span> to abandon printing.</p>
<p><em>Printing a marked block</em>: if a block of
slots is marked when
the <strong>Print</strong> command is given, only the
marked slots will be
printed.</p>
<p><em>Multi-file documents</em>: if the <strong>Print</strong>
command is given in a
multi-file document, the current document will be saved if it is
modified, and the entire multi-file document will be printed, starting
with the first file.</p>
<h3>Microspace pitch&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PM&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Selects microspaced printed output. Gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Microspace printed output
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing the option to <span class="screen">Yes</span>
and pressing&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>
causes
subsequent output to be microspaced at the default spacing of 12/120ths
of an inch, giving a pitch of 10 characters per inch. A number can be
entered to specify an alternative spacing. For example, entering 10
gives 12 characters per inch. <span class="screen">Microspace</span>
is displayed at the
top right-hand corner of the Options Page display if it has been
selected.</p>
<h2>Highlighting text&nbsp;</h2>
<p>You can alter the style of text in your document by inserting
one of eight highlight codes in front of the text, and the same code
after the text to revert back to normal.</p>
<h3>Highlight codes</h3>
<p>The recommended assignment of the eight codes is as
follows:</p>
<table class="frames">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Code</strong></td>
<td><strong>Function</strong></td>
<td><strong>Printed example</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>
5<br>
6<br>
7<br>
8</td>
<td>Underline<br>
Bold<br>
Extended sequence<br>
Italic<br>
Subscript<br>
Superscript<br>
Alternative font<br>
User defined</td>
<td><span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined
type</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">bold type</span><br>
&#279; &#1195; &#960;<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">italic type</span><br>
<small><small>H<sub>2</sub>0</small></small><br>
<small><small>e=mc<sup>2</sup></small></small><br>
<span class="type">alternative font</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To obtain the right results when these codes are printed you
may need to create a printer driver; see <strong>Section Nine -
The Printer
Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>The codes are inserted into text with the following
commands:</p>
<p><strong>Underline (1) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PU</strong><br>
<strong>Bold (2) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PB</strong><br>
<strong>Extended Sequence (3) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PX</strong><br>
<strong>Italic (4) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PI</strong><br>
<strong>Subscript (5) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PL</strong><br>
<strong>Superscript (6) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PR</strong><br>
<strong>Alternative font (7) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PA</strong><br>
<strong>User Defined (8) -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PE</strong></p>
<p>These commands insert the corresponding highlight code at the
current cursor position. Successive occurrences of a highlight code
enable and disable the corresponding printer facility.</p>
<p>The effect of highlights 1, 2, 3, and 4 (underline, bold,
extended sequences, and italic text styles) are displayed on the screen
as underlined, bold, grey, and tiny characters respectively when the
cursor is moved onto another slot. When the cursor is on the same slot,
all highlight codes are displayed as the corresponding highlighted
numbers <span class="screen" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
1</span> to <span class="screen" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
8</span>.</p>
<p>Highlight characters are considered to be of zero width for
formatting and justification.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You can use&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">SPACE to create an 'exact
space' character.
This may help to create continuous underlining of titles etc.</p>
<h3>Insert Highlights -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PHI&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Inserts a specified highlight number in the text at the cursor
position. Gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Highlight number</span></p>
<p>Typing in a number between 1 and 8, followed by&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>, will
insert the corresponding highlight code into the text.</p>
<h3>Remove Highlights -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PHR&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Removes all occurrences of a specified highlight number from a
given marked block of text. Gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Highlight number</span></p>
<p>Typing a number between 1 and 8 followed by&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span> will
remove all occurrences
of the corresponding highlight from the marked block.</p>
<h3>Highlight Block -&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">PHB&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Highlights all words within a marked block of text with a
given highlight number. Gives the prompt</p>
<p><span class="screen">Highlight number</span></p>
<p>Typing a number between 1 and 8 will remove any existing
highlights of the same number and highlight all words in the marked
block with pairs of the specified highlight character. Because
individual words are highlighted, reformatting the highlighted block of
text will leave the selected text correctly highlighted, and text will
be printed correctly even if the highlighted block extends over a page
break.</p>
<h1><a id="Expression slots">Expression slots</a></h1>
<p>Any slot in a PipeDream document can be designated as an
expression slot, in which case the expression you type into it will be
evaluated, and the result will be displayed in the corresponding
position in the document.</p>
<p>An expression is entered by giving the <strong>Edit
Expression</strong> command
on the <strong>EDIT</strong> menu, or by typing&nbsp;<img style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="diamond" src="images/symb_diamond.png">X. The cursor will then move
to the
editing line, at the top of the screen, until the expression is entered
by typing&nbsp;<span class="key">ENTER</span>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the Options Page <strong>Text/Numbers</strong>
option is set
to <span class="screen">N</span>, all entries are
taken as expressions.</p>
<h2>Expressions&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Expressions can consist of numbers, functions performing
operations on other expressions, references to other slots, or a
combination of these combined by mathematical operators. Expressions
can give a numerical result, a date, or a string of text. Illegal
expressions will give an error as their result.</p>
<h3>Numbers&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Numbers can be expressed in normal notation, or scientific
notation. For example,</p>
<p><span class="type">1, -1.7632, 1.4e27, 0.001</span></p>
<p>All calculations are performed to an accuracy of nine decimal
places and numbers may lie between 1e38 and 1e-38.</p>
<h3>Strings&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Strings are entered between double quotes, and may contain
spaces. A slot reference to a text slot returns a string.</p>
<h3>Slot references</h3>
<p>The form of a slot reference is</p>
<p><em>column-label row-number</em></p>
<p>separated by optional spaces, where</p>
<p><em>column-label</em> designates one of the 64
columns, A to Z,
followed by AA to BN, and</p>
<p><em>row-number</em> is from 1 to 32768.</p>
<p>Slot references are normally 'relative'; the reference will be
updated if the position of the slot containing the reference changes
relative to other slots.</p>
<p>Each half of the slot reference may be 'fixed' by preceding
the column letter or the row number by a dollar sign. The possibilities
are:</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="type">A1</span><br>
<span class="type">$A1</span><br>
<span class="type">A$1</span><br>
<span class="type">$A$1</span></td>
<td>&nbsp;normal reference&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;fixed column reference <br>
&nbsp;fixed row reference&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;fixed column, fixed row</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The fixed part of a reference is not altered when copied with
the <strong>Replicate</strong> or <strong>Copy</strong>
commands on the <strong>BLOCKS</strong> menu, or when
placed in a
selection expression for the <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Print</strong>
commands on the <strong>FILES</strong> and
<strong>PRINT</strong> menus respectively.</p>
<p>When a slot to which a slot reference refers is deleted, the
slot reference is marked with a '%' sign to indicate that the reference
is no longer valid. The expression containing the slot reference will
display the <span class="screen">Badslot</span>
error message.</p>
<h3>Specifying a block of slots - Ranges</h3>
<p>You can perform some functions on a block of slots, specified
by the top left-hand corner of the block followed by the bottom
right-hand corner of the block.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p><span class="type"> A2 D8</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>specifies all the slots in the block between columns A and D,
and rows 2 and 8 inclusive.</p>
<p>In some cases the function only makes sense if the range is
restricted to a single row (a 'row range') as in A1 D1, or a single
column (a 'column range'), as in B8 B20.</p>
<h3>Specifying several slots - Lists&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Functions are available to count, choose from, or find the
maximum or minimum of a list of elements. The elements in a list are
separated by commas and can be simple slot references, or ranges. Each
slot in a range is considered as a separate list element. For
example,</p>
<p><span class="type">13, B1 B5, C7,</span></p>
<p>is a list containing the 7 elements <span class="type">13,
B1, B2, B3, B4, B5,</span> and <span class="type">C7</span>.</p>
<h3>Dates&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Dates are entered in the format</p>
<p><em>DD.MM.YYYY</em> or <em>MM.DD.YYYY</em></p>
<p>depending on whether the Panel date-format setting is European
or American.</p>
<p>Dates can be sorted into chronological order, and the
functions DAY, MONTH, and YEAR can be used to extract the values of the
date's day, month, and year respectively.</p>
<h2>Operators&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The following operators can be used within
expressions</p>
<h3>Arithmetic&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The arithmetic operators take two numbers as operands.</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>+<br>
*<br>
^&nbsp;</td>
<td>add<br>
multiply<br>
raise to the power</td>
<td>-<br>
/</td>
<td>subtract<br>
divide</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Also, '+' and '-' may be used on date values. For example</p>
<p><span class="type"> 12.10.1987 + 127</span></p>
<p>will return the date 127 days after 12 October 87, or 16.2.88,
assuming that European date format has been selected.</p>
<h3>Relational</h3>
<p>The relational operators can compare dates, strings, and
numbers. Both operands must be of the same type, and the result is a
logical value of FALSE=0 and TRUE=1.</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;<br>
&lt;=<br>
&lt;&gt;</td>
<td>less than<br>
less than or equal to<br>
not equal to<br>
</td>
<td>=<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;=</td>
<td>equal to<br>
greater than<br>
greater than or equal to</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When strings are being compared, the following wildcards (as
in the <strong>Replace</strong> command) can be included
in the second string:</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>^?<br>
^# <br>
^^</td>
<td>matches any single character<br>
matches any number of characters<br>
represents ^</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Logical&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The logical operators operate on numeric or logical values.
Boolean FALSE is taken as zero, TRUE as non-zero.</p>
<table class="transperent">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&amp;<br>
!</td>
<td>AND<br>
unary NOT</td>
<td></td>
<td>OR</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

were placed at B4:</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 93px;" alt="" src="images/151.png"></p>
<p>If an exact match is found in range1, the function returns
the value of the slot the same number of slots from the beginning of
the second range.</p>
<p>If key is not found in range1, the function returns the error</p>
<p><span class="screen"> Lookup</span></p>

<h2>@ Fields</h2>
<p>You can include the page number, the date, the file title from
the Options Page, or the value of any expression slot within text in
your document using the special PipeDream @-fields.</p>
<p>The following @ fields are available:</p>
<table class="frames">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Identifier</strong></td>
<td><strong>Effect</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="type">@P@</span> <br>
<span class="type">@D@</span> <br>
<span class="type">@T@</span> <br>
<span class="type">@</span><em class="type">ref</em><span class="type">@</span> <br>
<span class="type">@@</span>&nbsp;</td>
<td>current page number
<br>
date
<br>
title defined in options page
<br>
value of slot <em>ref</em><br>
@</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One or more '@' characters should be given after the
identifier to determine the size of the @ field for formatting. For
example,</p>
<p><span class="type">@P@@@@</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>creates a field of four characters. Provided the value to be
displayed is less than the size of the&nbsp;@-field, the line will
be
justified correctly.</p>
<p>The field:</p>
<p><span class="type">@ref@@@@@</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will reserve five characters for the value of the slot
indicated by the reference.</p>
<p>If it is an expression slot, the value will be displayed in
the same format as in the slot itself, with alignment ignored.</p>
<p>When the cursor is not on a text slot with an @ field in it,
the slot shows the value of the @ field. When the cursor is moved onto
the slot, the actual @ identifier is shown, for editing.
