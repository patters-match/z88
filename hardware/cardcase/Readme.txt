3D printable replacement case for Cambridge Z88 cards  1/2/18
This case is much more rigid than the Cambridge one and uses 2mm nuts and bolts to clamp the PCB.
This should eliminate the problem of the PCB working loose and making bad contact.
The bottom half can be used with the standard Cambridge cover or with a 3D printed one 
Requires 2 x 2mm diameter, 8mm long countersunk bolts and 2 x 2mm nuts
