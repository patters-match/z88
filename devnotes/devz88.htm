<b><font size=+1>27. Developing software for the Z88</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Although it is possible to use the BBC BASIC as a development environment
for Z88 applications, the limited memory capacity of BASIC make this task
somewhat arduous. Moreover during development the Z88 is likely to crash
fairly often, so much time would be spent in backing up source files to
EPROM or another computer. The Z88 however, is not easy to break down.
We've managed to work for several months on software (using both a native
Z80 assembler and a cross assembler) with plenty of soft resets and without
loss of files. It depends on the type of crash. Software should always
be developed on the original computer - this is our philosophy!
<p>Finally, it is needed to have a unique application card id, if you are
going to produce EPROM card application software. When Cambridge Computer
still were manufactoring the Z88, they administrated the card id's. Since
they moved their office to Scotland (and have stopped production and interest
of Z88), the card id registrations were lost.
<p>InterLogic have made a substantial effort to produce a fully featured
Z88 Assembler Workbench containing a native Z80 modular assembler and a
Z80 cross assembler written in ANSI C, linker and library manager to compile
large assembler application projects. The cross assembler has been compiled
for MSDOS &amp; LINUX (IBM) and QDOS (QL) operating systems. Further, a
Z80 machine code debugger have been developed to support single stepping,
tracing, breakpoints and many other features to analyse your applications
both on EPROM or in RAM. Finally, an application EPROM programming utility
has been implemented to produce your own application cards. To simplify
your development work, we have supplied a PCLINK II compatible transfer
software and over 80 different standard library routines to use in your
applications - all as well documented source files.
<p>The Z88 Assembler Workbench have been made to give the Z88 users new
possibilities. Our work comprising of more than 40000 lines of assembler
code and C programming have been difficult, but fun. We hope that you will
enjoy our software.
<p>If you have any suggestions to these notes or would like to report bugs
on software (hopefully not!) please feel free to contact us:
